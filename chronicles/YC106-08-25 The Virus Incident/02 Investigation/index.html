<p>Preliminary Report</p>
<p>To: PIE officers<br>
Status: Internal</p>
<p>During todays briefing session, I was made aware of an unusual escrow deal being offered to PIE at the Emperor Family station in Amarr.</p>
<p>Taking it upon myself to investigate, I summoned a recon wing before claiming the escrow in question.</p>
<p>I will withold the destination point until further investigations have been completed, but our findings were interesting.</p>
<p>The wing warped in on seven abandoned Impairor class vessels, and long range scanners showed no potential hostile craft within 10000 clicks.</p>
<p>Ordering my wingmen Nemesis I and Khyan to hold position at the site, I returned to HQ and boarded a Crucifier class intelligence gatherer.</p>
<p>Upon my return, the abandoned vessels were scanned.</p>
<p>Their mounted loadouts proved uninteresting, but their cargo was another matter entirely:</p>
<ul>
<li>RIN Soul of Amarr - 1 Viral Agent, 1 Khumaak, 1 Corpse (Jafi Aphuka)</li>
<li>RIN Servant of God - 1 Viral agent, 1 Khumaak</li>
<li>RIN Warden - 1 viral agent, 1 khumaak</li>
<li>RIN Adamant - 1 viral agent, 1 khumaak</li>
<li>RIN Faithful - 1 viral agent, 1 khumaak</li>
<li>RIN Resolute - 1 viral agent, 1 khumaak</li>
<li>RIN Righteous - 1 viral agent, 1 khumaak</li>
</ul>
<p>After a brief discussion with the PIE personnel at the site, it was decided to take the vessels in question into PIE custody and move them to a quarantine site some 1000 clicks off the original location of the Impairors.</p>
<p>Bookmarks to this location can be obtained by contacting myself.</p>
<p>All the ship systems have been disabled, the cargo left intact save for the corpse of Jafi Aphuka, which has been properly sealed off and moved to PIE HQ for medical testing.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>Medical results can take a while to analyse, as such I suggest we test the viral agent out in containment at the quarantine site, exposing slave livestock to the viral agents.</p>
<p>This is clearly some vile matari plot against the Empire, and we should uncover the truth to this matter as efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>Scum! So much for your Emperor's edict about humanely treating slaves. But why stop at just generally using any ol' slave that happens to be available. Why not use children Matari? Can you deny that even your blackened Amarri heart crumbles when you look at their tiny little faces? What will you do with your memories of their horrible deaths? Will you hide behind your Emperor, pointing to your god, and say "It was for the good of the Empire!"</p>
<p>Scum.</p>

<p>+++ BEGING REPORT +++</p>
<p>To: FoM Command<br>
cc: Mastuat'aa Matari Command</p>
<p>Commanders. I have recently taken upon operations without the jurisdiction of your command, i can only hope my course of action was the right one. After noting with interest intercepted communications about these deathships, i noted contact with Acharya and managed to retrieve the last known co-ordiantes of these 'Deathships'. Along with brother Darax and sister AngelGrinder we proceeded to Amarr space to locate these ships and see if we could deduce what was happening.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at co-ordinates we found no evidence of the ships, however, Darax managed to locate the ships sitting 1000k out and we proceeded to this location. Upon arrival we found 7 Amarrian frigates and a cargo container.</p>
<p>The cargo container contained.. sorry commanders, the sight shook me somewhat, as the man was in a bad condition. we found a Matari, a slave judging by the slaver marks on him. he was unconcious and in a serious condition. I transfered the slave to a quaratine section of my hull, as rumours had persisted of a viral agent on these ships.</p>
<p>Upon scanning the 7 ships we located khumaaks and a viral agent upon each. After discussion with my fellow pilots, we decided to take a sample of this viral agent safely quarantined within my cargo hold and the khumaaks for analysis. We destroyed all the ships after we had retrieved the items. We judged that from what information we had gleaned this viral agent was very dangerous and could ill afford it getting into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>I am now on my way out of the system and am requesting orders as to the safest place to take these objects, i suggest a remote outpost. Speed is of the neccesity as the slave we rescued may not last much longer.</p>
<p>Also commanders... there was a number of PIE in system, they knew of our presence, and i have no doubt they knew of our destination (though i may be mistaken here) but we were not challenged or engaged and were able to make our escape without seeing a single enemy. i find this... perplexing.</p>
<p>Awaiting Orders ASAP<br>
Khaldorn Murino</p>
<p>+++ END REPORT ++++</p>
<p>Khaldorn felt the sweat dripping down his body even inside the pod. He had tried to keep the report as short as possible but there was something not right here at all. He had no trouble killing slavers, for the freedom of his people he would do much. But it seemed someone wanted to do much much more than that.. he had to get his cargo back, perhaps the scientist could decipher the agent. Perhaps the freed Matari would know something. If he survived...</p>

<p>Hypocrite. Here we have brave Amarrians uncovering a plot to strike at the heart of the Empire by sending ships loaded with a viral agent into key stations, stations populated not only by soldiers but mainly by civilians (yes, children, too) and <em>slaves</em> (your brethren I daresay), and you dare to come here and question the methods of Inquisitor Gaius?</p>
<p>YOUR people were out to kill thousands of Amarrians (not counting the slaves as your terrorist brothers apparently DO NOT DO EITHER!) - how dare your bemoan that it is tested on your brethren now? An eye for an eye.</p>
<p>Those who have eyes to see can see:
RIN Soul of Amarr - Amarr Prime, Emperor Family
RIN Servant of God - Amarr Prime, Theology Council
RIN Warden - Kor-Azor Prime
RIN Adamant - Tash-Murkon Prime
RIN Faithful - Ardishapur Prime
RIN Resolute - Kador Prime
RIN Righteous - Sarum Prime</p>
<p>(or any other order for the last five). Never rely on traitors. God's eye sees through all veils.</p>

<p>Scum! So much for your Emperor's edict about humanely treating slaves. But why stop at just generally using any ol' slave that happens to be available. Why not use children Matari? Can you deny that even your blackened Amarri heart crumbles when you look at their tiny little faces? What will you do with your memories of their horrible deaths? Will you hide behind your Emperor, pointing to your god, and say "It was for the good of the Empire!"</p>
</details>
<p>Calm yourself slave. I have already spoken with the CVA scientists responsible for the testing.</p>
<p>A small blood and tissue sample is all that is needed to test the effects of the virus under microscope in our labs. This can be obtained from the donor slave with absolutely no pain or other ill effects. None will be harmed in the process, that I can assure you. Amarrian tissue donors will be needed as well no doubt, as we need a diverse assortment of blood types.</p>
<p>Our people are not animals, that role is already taken. We lead by example to show you how to become better than what you are now.</p>

<p>My brethren.</p>
<p>I expected your full support during this operation, and even though my methods have been brought into question, I dare you question my results.</p>
<p>Medical examination of the retrieved corpse is currently underway, but we have no results to speak of as yet. It might become necessary for us to enlist the assistance of the infamous Jericho Fraction geneticist Athule Snanm to obtain the intel we are looking for. He has no equal within his field of expertise.</p>
<p>However, as predicted, the following cycle of events have taken place.</p>
<p>Intelligence leaks due to the low security rating of my former briefing made terrorist elements aware of the ongoing debacle. The subsequent 'easy to find' quarantine post was located by the very same terrorist elements.</p>
<p>They would not only happen upon the ships at the site however, I had previosly taken it upon myself and a tech crew to deposit a slave at the site, and subsequently exposed him to the agent. I take full personal responsibility for this fact, but neither will I share with you the credit for my action.</p>
<p>As noted by Tharrn, the CEO of Primus Pilum, a loyalist corporation, I have reasons to believe the ships were primed at essential installations in the heart of our Empire. Two in Amarr Prime, one each in the regional capitals of our Heirs.</p>
<p>By 'allowing' the terrorist elements access to the quarantine site, they did our work for us, as I just recieved confirmation that all seven Impairors have been destroyed.</p>
<p>Make no mistake. I wanted this site found, I wanted the slave retrieved and I wanted them home with their cargo intact.</p>
<p>I wanted them to witness their own abominable creation at work.</p>
<p>As an amusing sidenote, we recieved no communication of the Khumaaks present in the holds being destroyed along with the ships, as well as the names of known terrorists reported by CONCORD as being responsible for the destruction of said vessels.</p>
<p>They simply saved us the hassle of eventually destroying the vessels ourselves.</p>
<p>The infected slave has also been removed from the site, as predicted, and is most probably now in some scrapheap matari station, infected by the vile sickness they themselves sought to inflict on us. Let him now infect his own kin instead, if the matari be careless enough to break containment procedures.</p>
<p>Let them fight to find a cure, if my suspicions are correct regarding the slave in question, there is little hope for him as I made certain he had in no way been exposed to any chemical substances in advance.</p>
<p>Knowing the freedom fighters and their ilk, I would suspect either a trigger for the viral agent to activate, OR the PRESENCE of such to keep it IMPOTENT. What better trigger to keep the viral agent impotent than vitoc?</p>
<p>My only regret now is that I did not deposit a vitoc reliant slave in the containment alongside the clean livestock. He could then witness the same subhuman sufferings his 'saviors' would want to inflict upon thousands of innocent lives. IF my assumptions are correct, of course, but I am rarely mistaken.</p>
<p>We must be prepared for eventual repetitions of this action, and certainly the matari scum have in their posession a sample of the viral agent by now, but it does not matter.</p>
<p>So do we.</p>

<p>Preliminary report</p>
<p>To: Hedion University Medical Lab<br>
From: Amarria Darcrest, Attache Supervising Medical Officer<br>
Status: Internal</p>
<p>This report will describe, in brief, my preliminary findings of the case of viral outbreak here at the Emperor's Station, Amarr system, Eve-Standard Time 02:04.</p>
<p>As already known, thirteen cases of viral outbreak have occured at the Emperor's Station today. Directed by the Medical Officer, I traveled from Hedion University Labs to Amarr to act as a knowledgeable observer of the efforts by the station medical teams to quarantine and evaluate the source of this contagion.</p>
<p>My arrival was unnoted as the entire medical staff of Emperor's Station were actively involved in traige of new patients, scrambling to ensure that the problems noted by the incoming did or did not match the symptoms of the thirteen confirmed cases of this outbreak.</p>
<p>The medical staff here have labeled it "Scourge," but that is not proper or indicative of the scale of this problem. It is my opinion, after observing these cases, that the virus was contained prior to further contamination.</p>
<p>As the staff were busy, I perused their records, which seemed lacking in many areas. Only the first three cases were recorded in the standard Medical-Record Process. Only one thing connected these people that caught my eye.</p>
<p>They were all newly graduated pilots.</p>
<p>The medical staff had the wherewithal to quarantine all other stationed and visiting pilots to verify their health status.</p>
<p>I will make further reports as needed. I do not forsee any further outbreak, or cause for alarm.</p>
<p>END OF REPORT</p>
<p>Amarria turned from the NeoCom, setting the message to its destination in Sehmy. As she pulled her uniform down, and played with the wrinkle forming along her waist, an Amarri woman hurried past her to the Admissions Station, carrying a small child whose lips and ears were blue.</p>

<p>Ezar looked on with horror in his eyes at the realization of what Kador has done. He quickly switched off the report, tightened the collar marking him a priest, and he straightened the stole marking him a deacon. The stole's holy Amarrian crest shone brightly in the muted light of his cabin, but it brought him no comfort.</p>
<p>He looked down and uttered a prayer:</p>
<p>"Lord God save our souls for what we have done today.</p>
<p>Forgive us our sins dear God, and have mercy on us.</p>
<p>Today what we have looked into the eyes of the monster and indeed found it within ourselves.</p>
<p>Give us your grace that we may redeem ourselves in your eyes."</p>
<p>Ezar solemnly touched the com switch. "Captain?"</p>
<p>The strong Amarrian voice of his ship's captain replied, "Yes sir?"</p>
<p>"Set a course for Pator, we have work to do. We depart immediately"</p>
<p>"Acknowledged Admiral."</p>
<p>Ezar muttered despondently to himself, "Lord Gaius Kador, what have you done?", and he headed for the flag bridge of the TES Holy Commandment. The hum of the starship drives grew louder as they broke orbit of Amarr Prime.</p>

<p>Amusing bit of reading this.</p>
<p>What if my assumptions are incorrect? What if the viral agent does not need a trigger, or a different trigger?</p>
<p>For me the concequenses are equal to none, we have a sample and will dig out the truth eventually.</p>
<p>The slave did what it was intended to do, I cannot ask for more of a simpleton matari.</p>
<p>Your freedom fighter brethren did what I expected of them as well.</p>
<p>On a sidenote I might be loosing it, you know I missed the pod of your compatriot Al Haquis after tearing his Stilletto to pieces the other night. That is for another thread though, stay on topic for once pup.</p>
<p>This is not about me, but about the barbaric nature of your terrorist movement.</p>
<p>I doubt we've seen the end of this debacle yet, and mayhaps you should look to your own for the reason of this potential disaster.</p>
<p>This is pure evil, and would NEVER have been even imagined from anyone serving in the CVA.</p>

<p>I have spoken with some of the Matari, they have no knowledge or signs of the sickness as of yet. Strange they didn't kill or attack me. I have just now docked with Oris station to care for those who are currently suffering with the effects of the virus.</p>
<p>I hope to at least give them proper last rites, medical personnel are ill suited for a Deacon's task.</p>
<p>I will pray for and comfort those in the throes of fever, hold the hands of those who cry out to God for an end to the pain, and guide those who pass on to Him.</p>
<p>I do not fear the virus, for my body is but a temporary vessel on my journey to Him. Instead I fear the holy and righteous judgement of the Lord. I cannot live a life without His grace and prescence. If God deems that I should not return from this duty, then let it be so.</p>
<p>Since this virus has thus far defied quarantine and containment, this may be my final communication. I will remain in Oris station in the meantime.</p>

<p>Pulgor&gt; Why are you calling me at this hour?</p>
<p>PC-4772&gt; Pulgor, there's been a problem.</p>
<p>Pulgor&gt; What is it?</p>
<p>PC-4772&gt; Remember the Lysome's III-B virus we isolated and contained from a Ministrey of War station a while back?</p>
<p>Pulgor&gt; Yeah I remember it.</p>
<p>PC-4772&gt; As I recall in your report, you reported that the Blood Raiders were contracted by the Ammatar to take that virus to bait you into going to Ammatar space right?</p>
<p>Pulgor&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>PC-4772&gt; It seems they have kept a portion for themselves. Our sources indicate that a viral agent with symtoms simular to Lysomes III-B has been discovered. I have measured the vial that we have and we are 2 milliliters short of the amount your report says was collected.</p>
<p>Pulgor&gt; That virus is fatel! Our antidote only works within the first 15 hours of infection. After that it is unstoppable and death is immanent in the next 24 hours. It also has a high mutation rate and our antidote may not work anymore! Has it gotten into the public!?</p>
<p>PC-4772&gt; We don't know, we know that PIE found some earlier and are running exparaments on it right now.</p>
<p>Pulgor&gt; See if your source can get a sample of the virus and make SURE it's Lysomes III-B, if it is, let me know. I'll have to put an advisory out and we will have to trace infection and contain it. If this thing gets in the open there is no limit to the damage it can do.</p>
<p>PC-4772&gt; Yes sir, should I do anything in the mean time?</p>
<p>Pulgor&gt; No, do not alert anyone. I don't want panic to break out before we can determine if it's Lysomes III-B. As well it has a short life with no host so it may have dissapated itself by now. That's how we managed to contain it at the Ministry of War station. Hopefully not many get infected in the meantime.</p>
<p>PC-4772&gt; Yes sir, I'll carry out your orders. Terminating transmission.</p>

<p>Khaldorn watched as the Biosuited medical team removed the slave from his hold. A tight quaratine had been set up around his ship and a containment team was usehering him into a de-contaminent chamber just to be safe.</p>
<p>He shook his head, something was not right here at all. Bio-warfare? He did not believe that any of his freedom fighters would do such a thing. To kill innocent people on a mass scale? that would make us as bad as the Amarrians.</p>
<p>No, something did not ring true here at all. Once he got out of decontamination he would talk to his superiors about his suspicions.</p>

<p>The worlds are turned upside down for me, here on the Emperor's Station in Amarr, the loss of life staggering not in the numbers (although there are a lot) but in the devastation on the people's faces.</p>
<p>This report notes for immediate release that MinMatar slaves are responding well. I state the facts as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matari slaves do contract the infection</li>
<li>Matari slaves maintain the standard symptoms for twelve hours generally</li>
<li>Matari slaves recover thereafter, and seem to return to normal health within the next few hours</li>
<li>Not every Matari slave survives the infection</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not understand the reasoning why, but I suspect this virus is designed to circumvent the controls introduced to their bodies, and then continue to the next round of infection through the slaves' themselves exponentially. I have yet to check on the slaves' circumstances and control-methods.</p>
<p>I am compiling this information now.</p>
<p>So many dying. I cannot imagine it would have come to this . . ..</p>

<p>PC-4772&gt; What is it?</p>
<p>Pulgor&gt; Any updates?</p>
<p>PC-4772&gt; Our source has managed to gain a sample of the virus that has been discovered. Under carful examination it appears to be a grown copy of the Lysomes-III-B culture. However it's been altered.</p>
<p>Pulgor&gt; Altered?</p>
<p>PC-4772&gt; Yes, the virus appears to have been altered to only affect Amarr tissue. Minmatar tissue seems to be immune. Caldari and Gallente tissue samples are enroute to examine reaction to those tissue samples. We have renamed this virus Lysomes III-B2. It is not a true mutation in the tradition of Lysomes viruses, it seems to have been forcibly altered.</p>
<p>Pulgor&gt; I see. So it looks like the Blood Raider's altered the sample they took?</p>
<p>PC-4772&gt; That's what confuses me. This work is far too good to have been done by the Blood Raiders. They can generally only get out-of-work hacks to do anything for them. It looks like the Blood Raiders sold the virus and whoever they sold it too had it altered is our working theroy.</p>
<p>Pulgor&gt; Makes sense.</p>
<p>PC-4772&gt; Now that we have confirmation. Should we send out an advisory?</p>
<p>Pulgor&gt; I don't think so.</p>
<p>PC-4772&gt; This infection is getting serious. An entire station is at risk of infection. I think we really need to get word of this out.</p>
<p>Pulgor&gt; It's not our virus anymore. They altered it and it's their problem now. I'm not taking responsability for their misuse of a virus they created.</p>
<p>PC-4772&gt; I understand that, but many Amarrians have been infected and it's only going to get worse. I really think we should do something.</p>
<p>Pulgor&gt; Our antidote may not work anymore. As for the Amarrians, god will teach them the lesson of their callousness in the matter, not me. God's lessons are harsh but swift. That's my final word on the matter, understood.</p>

<p>I could intercept some poorly encrypted or even plain commmunication
from you, that is why i contact you here.</p>
<p>One of our Pilots brought the Virus to Pator.
The Medic team isolated the virus.</p>
<p>From the intercepted Communications we know it must be "Lysomes III-B2"</p>
<p>However, our medic team did never see this before and neither they do understand
how it works or what it does.</p>
<p>We quarantined a survivor, and he seems to recover well.</p>
<p>Our pilot has not been infected.</p>
<p>However, from what i hear infected Amarrians dont seem to recover
that well from infections.</p>
<p>I can imagine what conclusions this must cause in the public.</p>
<p>I urge you to put rivalities aside and work with us together
to find out who the real originator/initiator of the "death ships operation"
is.</p>
<p>It may surprise many of my brothers if i state that i will pay a high price

<p>I applaud your resourcefullness, Zoolkhan. While I would not normally work with a Minmatar I think I can make this special exception. It is most likely that the new varient of the Lysome's Virus: Lysomes III-B2, Has been engineered in a labouritory to meet certain criteria. What this criteria is, we do not know.</p>
<p>I do have a wealth of information on the origional Lysomes III-B virus and am willing to give any research we have gained on it to anyone who wants it. As well, we do have the old antidote which worked on haulting the origional Virus so long as it was administered before 15 hours of the origional infection. If anyone wants any of Lysomes III-B antidote, I will supply it to them.</p>
