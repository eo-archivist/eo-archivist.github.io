The Sandstorm","text":"<p>The sands of the Greater Amamake desert howled outside the titanium-shelled bar at the base of the Twin Mounts of Amake\u2019Son. Luci\u2019s Bar was never much of a spot for traders or pirates of any race, let alone the Matari and Amarr who lived in the system.</p> <p>But tonight there were a dozen of each filling the small room.</p> <p>\u201cBah, what do the Matari know of ghosts?!\u201d</p> <p>Ensign Serfh said, bolting back some Amarr brew. \u201cI mean, real ghosts! Not the spook stories told by their fat, ugly women!\u201d</p> <p>Dour stares from the Matari deep-space traders at other tables ended the laughter from the assembled group of Amarrians seated around the table with Ensign Serfh.</p> <p>Rather sinister looking spacers seated along the wall seemed to be keeping to themselves, Angels by the look of \u2018em, but they were listening too it even if they did not show it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about real specters\u201d Serfh continued.</p> <p>\u201cLike the terrorist Matari clans. I heard there was another bombing run on a belt operation just last week. Blew up a bunch of soft-skinned miners. Maybe they got Ensign Castor too, ya think?\u201d</p> <p>No laughter ensued from that latest remark. This group of Amarrians had been waiting for the Ensign for over six hours, having heard nothing from him since the early morning. They couldn\u2019t leave without him, and any more time spent here would surely corrupt even the most pious Amarrian.</p> <p>\u201cThere are the Paratwa . . .\u201d said d another Amarr, his voice lowering as that last word spilled across his lips. The wind howled, which was not particularly different on this night except that the whole of Luci\u2019s Bar had gone silent, heightening the words.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, there\u2019s them,\u201d Serfh added. He turned to the bartender, bellowing out for more brew. \u201cAnd there\u2019s the other ones too, I heard of them. The Cast-Off.\u201d</p> <p>The bartender stumbled when Serfh spoke of the Cast-Off, nearly spilling the brew onto the Ensign\u2019s ragged, but yet finely decorated uniform.</p> <p>\u201cWatch it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy apologies, Sir . . . but, we . . . we don\u2019t mention them here . . .\"</p> <p>Serfh laughed, smashing his glass down on the table even as the bartender tried to retrieve it.</p> <p>\u201cThem? The Cast-Off? Yeah, I heard of them. Loners and crazies they say!\u201d</p> <p>Serfh stood, throwing his arms up and dancing in a small circle, laughing.</p> <p>\u201cThe Cast-Off,\u201d he bellowed, causing all to turn at the loudness of his voice and derision in his tone. \u201cThey were once Paratwa, now just shells of Matari with no home. How sad!</p> <p>With that, he threw his glass against the far wall, past the bar where it clattered wildly against the shelves filled with alcohol. He continued to laugh at the bartender until he noticed that no one was paying attention to him at all. He turned to see the door of the Bar had opened, the howling wind barely a whisper across his ears. How had he missed the wind dying down?</p> <p>A woman perhaps, Matari for sure, dressed in typical sand-wear, entered the bar and took the short path through the crowd of tables to sit at the center of the bar.</p> <p>Her gear was the color of sand, and only her shape could be seen beneath the layers of leather and fabric. She even smelled of sand and earth, and the hairs on the backs of the heads those she sat next to rose as if she were charged with the electrical current that accompanies all sandstorms.</p> <p>Not one to be ignored, Serfh pulled the bartender\u2019s shoulder round from the woman who had entered, leering into the man\u2019s somber face. \u201cWhat say you, Matari? What say you of the Cast-Off? Are they as fearsome as they say?\u201d</p> <p>The bartender closed the small space between them, staring eye for eye, whispering, \u201cWe do not tarry too long in the darkness, Amarri. That is where the Rona Paratwa live.\u201d</p> <p>Serfh turned to his mates and pointed to the bartender, laughing. \u201cThere you have it! A wives\u2019 tale, and a bad brew to boot.\u201d</p> <p>The door of the bar startled everyone as it banged against the wall, the latch having failed. Beyond, the wind had returned to its ceaseless howling, but even the thickness of the dust billowing into the bar, and the intense sound did not keep the patrons from staring as the woman simply walked back out into the storm.</p> <p>The door banged madly, and the chaos had set the bar\u2019s lights to swinging, lighting one side of the room, then the next.</p> <p>A deep-spacer sitting next to where the woman had stationed herself, held up a small bag.</p> <p>\u201cHey . . . she forgot this.\u201d</p> <p>Serfh watched as the bag slid open at the bottom, and an object dropped to the floor.</p> <p>People scattered, pushing up against the walls. When it did not immediately explode, Serfh pushed away a table and kicked the object. The swinging lights made it difficult to see what the thing was, but he had no doubts.</p> <p>He stared into the eyes of Ensign Castor, the Amarr\u2019s head only lightly covered in blood. A small crescent shaped mark on the forehead glistened under the swinging lights, really just the skull underneath where the skin had been cut away.</p> <p>The door continued its hectic banging as the sandstorm blew out across the desert and between the Twin Mounts of Amake\u2019Son, the place where the Cast-Off were said to slumber.</p> <p>Sister RageChild skirted the pillars of the temple as the Paratwa gathered. Determination and sadness and unadulterated anger filled her as the assembly of bodies milled about smartly \u2013 determination to carry out her plan, sadness at leaving the Sect and anger at the leader \u2013 careless, retributive anger but controlled simply through her will.</p> <p></p> <p>Wherein could she find that original spark of faith that had led her to the doors of the Paratwa? The knowledge that she was Paratwa, that her creator, Cizin, had imbued her body with the soul of the elite warriors filled her with strength, but truly the euphoria had ended quickly. The battles won, the engagements done, wherein was her faith? She saw it sometimes like the seventh moon skirting the horizon, just out of reach, but for her and her alone, she felt disjointed.</p> <p>Her counterpart, her tway surely must be out there, in the broad universe. Perhaps it was Gaelbhan Wulf herself? She was not sure, but such thoughts did not need to be aired here, at the assembly, for only her determination had time today.</p> <p>Sister RageChild walked steadily out of the temple even as the Faith of Cizin began in along droning monotone from within. The bright morning air energized her legs, and soon the rifter lifted off, spraying soil and plants in every direction. The afterburner kicked in as the rifter flew over the temple, shooting RageChild into the tropopause, and surely drowning out the ceaseless worship happening below.</p> <p>Cuddled inside the ship\u2019s gel, she settled in for the journey to Amamake, beginning her meditation. Her thoughts intruded, wildly at first then more orderly. Where would she find her tway? What ancient memories lay dormant within her and her tway? To speak of the Paratwa was to speak of genetic manipulation from even the earliest days of humanity before the gate. In those days, cience dictated and religion followed. Her mouth lifted from intensity to a smile.</p> <p>The science of that age did not believe in Cizin, but Cizin believed in them. The Transitional One, Lord of the Deep Spaces, God of Fire and Ice, he had given the scientists the knowledge to create genetic warriors. As these bodies matured in their tanks, ready for awakening, Cizin filled the body cavity, that Space-Between, with a soul. The soul of a Paratwa.</p> <p>It was the discovery of the joined mind that brought the Paratwa into the view of the world\u2019s leaders both secular and religious, that the cloned bodies were actually joined in pairs, tways. These tways maintained their own bodies, but shared the same mind. Wars ensued as leaders attempted to destroy these atrocities, instead falling to the shared-mind assassins. Chaos and near world destruction were imminent, but suddenly the Paratwa vanished. As millennia of history unfolded, standard cloning became more common. Cizin no longer needed to cultivate the scientists. He could imbue the soul of the Paratwa into bodies across the universe, as needed, to help rebalance the universe\u2019s energies. Balance was the mission of the Paratwa, but not always in the way many envisioned.</p> <p>RageChild calmed her thoughts as they became less orderly, letting her training take over. The ship\u2019s gel informed her, via her neural interface, the status of the ship and her mind became the ship in meditation. Her sister-of-faith, Gaelbhan Wulf, had felt Cizin called her onto a different path than that preached by those in the Sect of the Ra. RageChild felt similarly, images and emotions that swayed her from remaining in the Sect. Instead, she now sought something beyond that, renouncing her ties with the Sect.</p> <p>All questions and thoughts finally ceased in the meditation as the rifter piloted effortlessly through the Ortner constellation into Hed. She is now ronin. Many had followed before her, cast out by the Sect of the Ra or leaving of their own will, but these Paratwa did not assemble. They did not join into massive bands of free roaming warriors, instead finding their way through the Will of Cizin to continue the struggle of balance. Despite this, she sought her sister-of-faith. She would find no sympathy or help from the Sect, indeed it was almost anathema to speak of the Cast-Off in the presence of the Sect brethren. She had one thing to seek from her sister, Gaelbhan Wulf, and from there?</p> <p>Perhaps she might find faith from the faithless.</p> <p>Luci\u2019s Bar had been empty for weeks after the death of that Amarr ensign. Zayard, the bartender and owner, had been there when the ronin delivered the head of the Amarr back to his waiting friends. Hell, he had been there every day for twenty years serving alcohol to the locals, pirates and other space-lane visitors, but he had never seen such a thing as occurred that night. The sandstorms were an almost constant thing here, but the one many weeks ago was a downright gale.</p> <p>Tonight was a slow night again, and he busied himself with sweeping for the thousandth time. He swept the sand into a pile where the head of the Amarr had dropped, hoping the sand might just generally suck up any lasting residue \u2013 there had been almost none anyway, bloodless as it was. It just made Zayard feel better to think the sandstorm that spawned that night\u2019s horrors would keep its memory from returning too.</p> <p>\u201cThe sand?\u201d A voice whispered in his ear. He jumped back, knocking tables and chairs about. Zayard looked at the face of anger, a Matari woman with blazing red hair. The door was wide open, the sandstorm still raging \u2013 how had he missed her entering? How could he have missed the cacophony of sound as the storm threatened to tear the bar from its foundation now that the door was wide open?</p> <p>\u201cI . . . I, the sand?\u201d Was all he could muster.</p> <p>\u201cYou were thinking of the sand, and about the Amarr,\u201d she said. Standing in the center of the bar, she imposed herself in the path of three Angels who seemed to just want to leave now as she continued to speak. \u201cBut then, no doubt you can think of nothing else in a place such as this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI . . . I, yeah,\u201d he muttered, again the only thing he was able to muster.</p> <p>The woman closed the distance between them, their tattoos practically merging as she pulled close into his ear. Zayard nodded as she whispered into his ear, then slowly raised his finger to point north \u2013 north to the Twin Mounts of Amake\u2019Son.</p> <p>He stumbled down to one knee as she left, her presence and closeness having supported him. Through the door he watched as the woman with the red hair became as the sandstorm \u2013 he thought she would surely be stripped to bones, but he laughed. No, that was foolishness. How does the sand treat it\u2019s own kind?</p> <p>cont...</p>"},{"location":"books/book1/B1.02-Tertiary/","title":"2. Tertiary","text":"<p>The probe sputtered despite her best efforts, making barely twenty meters per second under the onslaught of the spatial tendrils surrounding it.</p> <p>\"Surrender, Matari. There is no escape.\" The voice said through the comm-interlink channel. The Amarr's punisher glistened in the sunlight of Osoggur, a shining example of bureaucratic efficiency.</p> <p>\"Yes, I know, I am suspected of terrorist activity,\" she replied back before the voice could continue. The comm-interlink quit, and Airgoidh Brendan wiggled her fingers, feeling the gel accept and modify the movement into color. Even as she sat helpless in the grip of the Amarrian webifier, she felt very comfortable and relaxed.</p> <p>She had at first rejected in horror the thought of climbing into a pod filled with liquid gel during her training at the Republic Military School, but now she felt only release of tension in both her body and mind. The neural interface lodged just beneath her left ear relayed the probe\u2019s condition to her brain, and her brain provided images in her mind that she could not distinguish as what her eyes might see or her dreams might create. A red wave-filled blob told her that the punisher was taking up an orbit around her probe. Blue, blinking indicator lights showed that her shields were down, and nearly half her armor now lay in a debris field around her ship.</p> <p>She willed the thruster control to station keeping, and then adjusted her latitude so that she was settled onto the same plane as the Amarr.</p> <p>\"Surrender, Matari. There is no . . .\" the voice began again.</p> <p>Airgoidh interrupting, \"Look, what evidence do you have that I am a terrorist? By what right do you ensnare me?\"</p> <p>\"I will tow your vessel to the station for inspection. Do not attempt . . .\"</p> <p>Airgoidh willed the volume to its lowest setting as she watched the red wave of the punisher settle into its orbit. Other colors indicated the Amarri ship\u2019s afterburners were in standby, its laser cannons maintaining a lock. He was right, she thought. There was no escape from such a situation other than to watch him orbit . . . She thought about ejecting and letting the autopilot scoot her pod away, but she wanted something else - his blood. Of course, that would be hard to get with this old wreck, but soon. Perhaps not today, but soon.</p> <p>A taste of guile filled her mouth as if with sweet bread. The gate to Amamake lay just ahead of her, the probe's nose pointing exactly in the direction of the multi-hued double helix that was the icon of a Stargate. The local channel was filled with pilots, some Amarr, but only this young pilot posed any danger. The comm-interlink moved those analog sounds into her brain, and she heard them holographically inside her head, her ears tingling as the words appeared as both sound and images. As a child she had assumed that whole crews manned ships all walking the decks to battle stations or even to the mess hall for chow. Learning that even the largest battleships required only one crew member amazed her, and horrified her too at the thought of the enveloping gel filling her body, and certainly disgust at the thought of breathing it.</p> <p>Airgoidh wiggled her fingers again, for there was nothing to do but watch him orbit. Movement in the gel created secondary colors in her mind, and certain movements could initiate a ship\u2019s command function. She waited until his ship had begun another orbit of the probe. He slid to her left past the wing, flying to a point just before he started to turn past her . . .</p> <p>\"What's your name?\" She asked.</p> <p>\"What?\" The voice seemed incredulous. His name was clearly displayed on the HUD.</p> <p>She punched her arms away from her in short bursts, and her probe\u2019s thrusters lurched the ship forward another 200 meters for just the one second needed to fall out of the range of his webifier.</p> <p>She laughed as her probe's trajectory had kicked her over the line.</p> <p>\"Watch your orbit next time,\" she said to no one as the comm-interlink became static.</p> <p>The three AU warp dropped her just at the jump range of the Gate, which she hastily attended to even as the punisher fell in behind her. She encircled the multi-hued double helix with her hands, and then pressed her palms together. Her motions cued the neural interface, which then accessed the Stargate, received recognition and relayed acceptance back into her mind; such was the power of the brain interface, to allow the mind to see the images and interact with them physically via the gel.</p> <p>No time for long goodbyes, she thought, the gate enveloping her ship with spatial cloaking. The image in her mind, which she could touch with her hands, was one of the double helix wrapping her body in tendrils of white light. That white light became darkness as the cloaking activated, and then a short period of visual cacophony.</p> <p>Jumping always made her hyperactive even though the ship's gel was supposed to prevent any of the gate\u2019s energies from affecting the pilot. Little in the way of productive thought could be accomplished in the jump, more the mind was frozen in dreams and memories that flooded to the surface. Her memories were of the slaver pens, constellations filling the sky there were so many slaves.</p> <p>The jump always ended at the memory of her owner dying by the stroke of his own lance, and then falling into her lap. A face appeared from the early morning haze before her, a face that she had seen in dreams since her earliest childhood, a face of a Matari woman whose own blood was pouring from many wounds.</p> <p>The jump ended in its characteristic jolt, and Airgoidh locked Amamake VI into the gel by grasping the grey ball that was the planet in her right hand. She warped away just as the Amarr appeared from his temporary cloak. Damn he was fast.</p> <p>Amamake VI was a desert for the most part, habitable but only if you liked to eat sand at every daily venture outside. The probe had already been programmed for the landing coordinates, but the Amarr was on her six as she started into the atmosphere.</p> <p>Four more local Amarr had answered his call for assistance, and she could see them dropping in next to him in her mind.</p> <p>Her shields were barely charged, and being knocked down with the combined might of at least five laser cannons. She diverted the probe's descent slightly to land farther away from the settlement of Amake'Son than she would have liked, but the grid showed a series of caves nearby in some malinite outcroppings - better shielding against their scans.</p> <p>The ship wheezed as the lasers punctured her hull. The engines simply quit, the gel reacting by turning that portion of the envisioned ship a dull gray. Listing to the left, nose down, she could feel the ground approaching too fast. The probe's damage control operated on emergency power now, and the pod\u2019s gel changed into a semi-solid rubber for the landing.</p> <p>Howling winds woke her, but it took her a moment to realize that her ears were actually hearing the sound rather than the sounds being in her brain. She punched out of the gel pack. Her body hurt, and she stumbled as she stepped out onto the sand, which burned her feet through the thin boots she had only just recently tolerated enough to wear. She had tended the slaver's paddy's her whole life, so what need for shoes?</p> <p>She ran for the outcropping as the punishers landed at 30 meters. The sand was as deadly to her speed as any webifier, but she knew the Amarr would be equally as slow. The Amamake sun was setting, and she thanked Cizin and Matar and every other known entity for that.</p> <p>Somewhere in this forsaken spot, the backdoor of the Amarr systems, she had to find the Matari woman who had saved her from the slaver a year ago, and whom she had saved in turn Airgoidh Brendan searched for her sister-of-blood, Gaelbhan Wulf.</p> <p>She had completed her training at the Republic Military School, and had heard her sister had come to this planet. For what reason? What of the Sect of the Ra? Rumors told of a schism in the Sect, one caused by Gaelbhan. Looking back, Airgoidh saw there was no time to delay.</p> <p>Below and only slightly behind her, the five Amarr were giving chase.</p> <p>Zayard heard the sound of ships flying overhead, heading out into the desert, but the one sound he knew well was the sound of a dying ship. It was quite unmistakable, the sheering of the fuselage as the ship became rubble even in mid-air. He pushed open the door of the bar, seeing the smoky trail leading into the malinite network. Some other ships followed, and he thought they looked Amarri, but they were too far away now to tell.</p> <p>Luci's Bar sat empty, as it had for the last two days. The death of the Amarr ensign, the strange visitors one right after the other, the threat of Amarr inspectors soon to arrive, all had taken its toll on his business. He looked back into the bar, seeing in his memories the faces of friends long dead and enemies still alive. His wife stood at the counter too, Matar bless her, but only for the moment it took to remember she had died there too.</p> <p>He let the door swing shut behind him as he started out to the dunes, snagging a breathing mask and some water. Might as well see what he could salvage from the ship. Trudging through the hot sun, the sandstorms gone for the moment, the bartender ignored the passers-by in this outland settlement. His wife had hated this planet, yelled at him more than once for being so stubborn about coming here, and for all the blasted sand that she found in every corner, every shoe. She also loved him, and he knew it. She loved his strength and determination to remain active even in these later years. She loved that he flew off into space to do battle with Amarrians and to run missions for thee Republic Security Services. She loved him for sticking with the promises made to the People\u2019s Front. She loved him. That was all that mattered.</p> <p>She died to protect that love. He found her, slumped over the bar, shot by unknown intruders. Could have been Angels, just as it could have been Amarrian bogey-men or even Ammatar slaver-scum. He never learned anything more than that she had died to keep the intruders from learning his whereabouts. Some of the settlers had been questioned by men dressed in sand gear about what they knew of him, but no one could identify them, not even by their dialect. Assassins yes, but what race they could not guess.</p> <p>And why had they never returned? He had burned his wife on the pyres to celebrate her return to the Halls of Matar, and he had remained in the settlement tending the same bar for years. Why had they never returned?</p> <p>Matar, he asked daily in prayers, why had he never been able to seek the Right of Retribution?</p> <p>cont...</p>"},{"location":"books/book1/B1.03-Patterns-of-Light/","title":"3. Patterns of Light","text":"<p>The malinite cave echoed with the thrumming of volcanic fissures untold thousands of meters below her. Heat and steam and noxious vapors filled her nose, assaulting her at every moment.</p> <p>In the center of a series of stalactites, Gaelbhan practiced the standing meditation known as Seitei-gata iaido, and though her senses were assailed from without, her mind did not wander from the form of the meditation or the two bright spots of light in her mind. Five other lights danced around the other two, deep red and black. They were growing stronger, closer, and soon would fill her entire mind.</p> <p>Her sisters had come to Amamake with uninvited guests it seemed. She twisted to the left with her upper body as the Seitei-gata iaido continued, her legs crouching as she swept upward to form the completing circle. Had it been truly one year now?</p> <p>One year ago, on the headlands of the Amarr Salten Sea, she had escaped the trap set by Daison Kador.</p> <p>She had escaped his compound on the Salten Sea, bypassing the guards and the slaver hounds with more success than she had in trying to escape his pistol.</p> <p>He had shot her, and the wound would not stop bleeding. Only the sea\u2019s wind smacking her face kept her conscious, and she took the time to perform the standing meditation there on the headlands despite her wound, despite the slaver hounds still on her trail.</p> <p>In her mind, and along her entire bruised and bleeding body she felt strength coming to her from another Matari, keeping her alive, a Matari close by on the headlands. She had run up into the forested cliffs semi-conscious, seeking this source of energy, but her wounds clouded her mind.</p> <p>Finding no one, she used the standing meditation to calm her thoughts and stabilize her body so she could locate the Matari who was sharing this energy. Slowly her mind weaved that source into a ball of light she could feel inside like warm apple ale, then immediately into a location and a name and a reason.</p> <p>Airgoidh.</p> <p>Airgoidh, who it so happened was her sister-by-blood.</p> <p>This woman had appeared in her dreams for many years, at first nebulous in both image and emotion, but growing more intense over the years. A face became more visible, but always in a fog.</p> <p>Despite the pain and exhaustion, the bright orb that was her sister demanded attention. Her legs and arms began to tighten sympathetically as the energy her sister was providing to her began to fail. She must hurry. She did not understand how her sister was doing this, and she did not believe her sister even knew what was happening to her.</p> <p>She had come to Sehmy at the request of Daison, and she felt it her obligation to answer his Right of Retribution. He was Amarrian, but he still had earned that Right. She had killed his mother after all, her owner, when she was ten.</p> <p>He had also added to his message that he knew the location of her sister, as added incentive for her coming to Sehmy \u2013 such tricks were an Amarrian\u2019s typical fare. She needed no further reason other than to honor his Right of Retribution. She had dismissed his lies about her having a sister.</p> <p>On the headlands, a year ago, she realized he had been telling the truth.</p> <p>The standing meditation ended, and Gaelbhan came out of it\u2019s completion. The memory of that day a year ago faded, the treachery of Daison, the rescue of her sister-of-blood from her owner, all replaced again by the stench of the malinite caves. In her mind, the seven lights were very close now.</p> <p>She gripped the lance in her hands, the same lance she had taken from her sister's enslaver. Very close.</p> <p>**</p> <p>Airgoidh pressed against the boulder under the palest moonlight she had ever seen. The wind had faded somewhat in intensity up here in the outcroppings, and though the moons were high and bright, only the tiniest bit of light fell to ground because of the dusty air. The Amarrians continued to fire blindly in her general direction, scorching rocks and laughing.</p> <p>\"Come out, Matari. Save yourself a load of trouble.\"</p> <p>\"She's going to get away,\" another said. \"Spread out and find her.\" It was her Amarri pilot from Osoggur.</p> <p>She heard them climbing rocks now. Though she could not be seen nor could she see them, one of them was coming up to her \u2013 she had placed her palms against the boulder, feeling his progress, calculating how long it would take for him to reach her. He was very close when the rock under her palms and under her feet grew extremely warm. She lurched outward into the path of the Amarr as the rocks became burning hot.</p> <p>\"There you are! Don't move.\" His pistol leveled to her chest, barely a meter from her. She could only look at her hands, red from the intense heat. \"Hey! What's the matter? Heat stroke?\"</p> <p>The pilot laughed, then he too looked down at his feet, yelping. A shadow jumped from a high boulder, dropping in front of the Amarr, pushing him backwards down the rocky hillside.</p> <p>Pistols fired and a hand grabbed hers as they ran back into the outcropping. Deep red hair flowed behind this woman, and though Airgoidh did not recognize her, she followed. This was not Gaelbhan, but the woman was running from the Amarr and that was good enough for her.</p> <p>The outcropping became a maze of miniature canyons, and they turned into endless openings until they reached the farthest side of the malinite rock pile. Airgoidh extracted her hand, and the woman turned.</p> <p>\"I am RageChild,\" she said as Airgoidh stared. \"They are still following us, so we can't rest here long.\"</p> <p>\"You are . . . I\u2019ve seen your face.\" Airgoidh reached slowly toward the woman, reached upward past the dark somber clothing to touch this Matari woman\u2019s face. \"I have seen your image in my mind. I have dreamed about you, yes, I'm sure of it.\"</p> <p>The woman calling herself RageChild chuckled, but seeing Airgoigh scowl she waved her hand dismissively. \"Do not be angry at me. I laugh only because you have a very strong Amarrian accent.\u201d Then, \u201cYou are not the first person I know who has talked of dreams in that way.\u201d</p> <p>Airgoidh looked back along the canyon they had just exited. Pistol fire in the distance, maybe 200 meters. \"What happened back there? I felt intense heat . . . I . . . I remember! Amarr lance!\"</p> <p>RageChild nodded. \"Yes, a lance and a well aimed one. Someone else is here with us in these rocks.\" She looked up along the canyon walls. \"I hadn't really intended on jumping down on the Amarr. I was about to fire on him when my feet became very hot, so I had to jump.\"</p> <p>Looking at Airgoidh, \"Your enslaver punished you with the lance. That is how you know of it.\"</p> <p>She did not answer in the affirmative, and for what reason?</p> <p>Instead she stepped out into the sands. The moons were closer to their horizons now, and the light was fading, but it would be morning in a few hours. She pointed along the wall of the outcropping, and the two continued their journey. \"My sister is over there now.\"</p> <p>RageChild nodded. \"Yes, I know.\"</p> <p>\"You are also seeking my sister? Why?\"</p> <p>\"Old business made anew. I am late of the Sect of the Ra.\"</p> <p>Dawn broke as the two hurried toward the single multi-hued light that grew in their minds. These lights had always been with them, as children, as slaves and as adults.</p> <p>Airgoidh had come to treaure the lights, for they always gave her a sense of location, of place and distance, but this other Matari woman had the same ability. Who was she? She had said she was Paratwa.</p> <p>\u201cYou were with my sister in Sect of the Ra?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, we joined the Sect at roughly the same time. We both discovered quickly over the few weeks that we were part of the Sect that what we wanted was not there.\u201d</p> <p>They were on the leeward side of the outcropping when the dawn broke for them as a pale pink light out to the horizon. Airgoidh felt a sandstorm coming, but perhaps not for another day.</p> <p>\u201cWhat were you seeking that you did not find with those ghosts?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnion.\u201d RageChild answered. \u201cBut I am surprised you call them ghosts. You are Paratwa as well. I can sense it, very clearly.\u201d</p> <p>A desert bird skittered out from rocks above them, and they ducked into a narrow fissure just as pistol fire scorched the soil where they had just stood in the dawn's light.</p> <p>Airgoidh pulled RageChild through the fissure, the malinite rock tearing at their clothing as they squeezed through tight spaces. More pistol fire, then heavy breathing of at least one Amarr who followed them.</p> <p>Airgoidh felt the cool air hit her before she fell through a tight opening between two boulders, RageChild stumbling in behind her. The circular canyon, barely twenty meters wide, opened straight into the sky. Several other paths led into this roundabout, but all of them were covered by the Amarr, waiting, pistols raised.</p> <p>**</p> <p>Zayard and about a dozen others made their way out the malinite network, affectionately called the Screaming Blades. He had hoped the other settlers wouldn't have been so interested, but any salvage was good salvage out here in the wastes of Amamake VI. He carried the lead though, by about ten minutes. The five Amarr punishers sat idle near the wreckage of a Matari vessel, the sand scorched black from the old girl's landfall.</p> <p>He moved in a circular path around the punishers, keeping them between him and the malinite network. He could see up into the outcropping, but anyone looking back toward him would see only the lights of the ships glaring back at them. The moons weren\u2019t bright, but the sand in the air was still pretty thick - little of the light made its way down to them.</p> <p>The first to reach the battered Matari vessel, Zayard headed straight into the cockpit area.</p> <p>Even used gel-pack was valuable, making great insulation from the heat. The others came up behind him, and were starting to drop choice items into their packs when pistol shots caught their attention.</p> <p>\"Always like Amarri to shoot up the place,\" one of the others said, drawing laughter.</p> <p>\"That's a good one, Joz,\" another replied, slapping the big Brutor on the back. \"When was it that you didn't bring along your pistol, heh?\"</p> <p>The Brutor smiled, and slapped the other one back, knocking the Matari on his butt. \"I've never gone without it. Or my sense of humor either.\"</p> <p>Zayard knew that to be truth of his age. Time was when Brutors would just blow up untended Amarri ships, or at least do some awful deed to the cockpit to the surprise of the returning pilot. Matar\u2019s Hell, he had done the same in his day.</p> <p>More pistol shots caused the others to wander back to the settlement, but Zayard watched with little interest in joining them. The Amarr were hunting a Matari in those malinite rocks, and he wanted to know why. He reached down into his boot, and extracted a pistol. Joz wasn't the only one who never left home without one.</p> <p>The wind was beginning to pick up, and perhaps tomorrow another sandstorm.</p> <p>cont...</p>"},{"location":"books/book1/B1.04-The-Devil-in-Store/","title":"4. The Devil in Store","text":"<p>Amarrian LTJG Maramer kneeled in the shade of the circular depression, the malinite rocks radiating intense heat. Sweating, he kept his pistol trained on the two women standing along the far wall. The other four pilots were equally as deadpanned, waiting for the sandstorm beyond to end, for the sun to finally set on this Emperor-forsaken planet, and for the two women to do . . . something.</p> <p>They stood back-to-back, each tall and thin. Red hair flowed from their heads in a strange breeze seeming to affect only them, looking very much like a mirror of each other. He wondered if they were sisters-of-blood. Their tattered clothing flowed in that strange breeze that had surrounded them, and even though they were in the full onslaught of the daylight, they were not sweating. Hell, the one had even taken off what was left of her torn boots, standing barefoot on the scorching sand.</p> <p>\"I'm not getting anything,\" one of the pilots said. He tapped the PAD unit again, but Maramer knew the malinite would affect their systems until they escaped these rocks.</p> <p>The ground rumbled again, a little heavier than before. Though they had gotten used to it, no one doubted the seismic proclivity of this area, and that it was ready for . . . something to happen. The outcropping used to run lava, but malinite took thousands of years to solidify so whatever lay immediately beneath them was not lava.</p> <p>\"One of us should go back to the ships, and call for back-up. I don't want these two getting away.\" Maramer said it, but immediately felt stupid -- five strong Amarri against two thin women, one barefoot and the other no longer in possession of her pistol. \"Who's volunteering?\"</p> <p>\"Volunteering?\" One of them laughed. \"I am not military. I got in on this hunt for whatever bounty is on their heads. I already volunteered,\" he continued, sweeping his hands into the air. \"But if I do not go, we will likely roast here and nothing will be gained.\"</p> <p>I'll go too,\" said another, a fat pilot with balding head.</p> <p>\"No, you stay. That would leave us too few to guard them.\"</p> <p>The fat pilot laughed. \"Afraid she'll jump ya again?\"</p> <p>Maramer stood, glaring at the pilots. He didn't dare tell them that there was no bounty for these women, really just suspected of black-marketeering. He needed all of the pilots to help get these women out.</p> <p>Blood from his forehead and along his left arm had caked since being jumped from above by the one woman. He stared at them and wrinkled his nose at the strong Matari scent. His family owned many slaves, educating them to be better people, but he never got used to their scent.</p> <p>The heat, the impatient pilots, all got him moving. Enough of this waiting \u2013 he strode to them, reaching out to shake something, anything out of their mouths. His hand began to burn, and he yelled out.</p> <p>\"What the . . .?\" The other pilots said in unison, pistols ready, eyes scanning the women, the rocks, and the sky. \"What's wrong?\"</p> <p>Maramer kneeled, his right hand clutched in his left, close to his chest. The searing pain had vanished, but he could see blisters forming even now. The two women hadn't even moved, nothing read across their faces at all. He blinked as he saw it again, something he dismissed as ludicrous. Yes, there . . . he could see their breath, like they were standing on the meadows of a winter's morning.</p> <p>\"Lance!\" He stood, trying to adjust the pistol into his left hand. He scanned the rocks above, but saw nothing. The other pilots stood around gawking. \"Someone is using a lance to shield them. Keep an eye out!\"</p> <p>That was the key to their unusual disposition, Maramer realized. The lance was set to shield, creating a barrier around them with those inside protected from heat as the lance drained the heat from the inside of the bubble to the outside -- the Emperor's best weapon, but also a formidable tool in the enemy's hands.</p> <p>The ground rumbled again, this time loudly. The pilots started to panic, looking as if about to run. \"Stop! The lance can't fire at the same time. Whoever's using it isn't about to let us hurt them, so stop running like rabbits and get up onto those rocks.\"</p> <p>The four pilots looked at Maramer, the two women still standing back-to-back, and darted into an openings in the outcropping wall. The ground continued it's rumbling, but this time a keening sound began to fill the depression. Even the women winced as the sound grew.</p> <p>The four pilots started to scream, and Maramer started toward the closest opening, but found the sound was echoing and increasing in intensity within - the poor bastards. The sound would drive them mad and then kill them all. He kept his back to the rocks, alternately looking at the two women, and the rocks above. He had to kneel as the keening increased, and he fell over in agony and unconsciousness.</p> <p>He dreamed of the Emperor, old and new, and of the two red-haired women who danced around him like the fire crickets of his home world. He swatted at them, but they always danced out of the way, moving as if they already knew where his hand would be before he struck. Maramer saw himself lying on the grass outside his childhood home now, spreading out and enjoying the warmth beneath him like the embrace of the Emperor. His arms and leg became heavy, spread out as if reaching for every point of the compass.</p> <p>He coughed, waking, spitting sand from his mouth. He felt sluggish, but thanked the Emperor that the keening sound from the malinite rocks had faded. He then noticed that his hands and feet were tied to the ground, staked out.</p> <p>He struggled, but the ropes were secure. The sun was beginning to set, and he heard the sounds of movement around him in the rocks. Heat continued to warm the circular depression, radiated from the rocks, probably enough to last through the night.</p> <p>Insects started to hover over him as he attempted to pull the stakes from the sand, but they were deeply buried and did not move. The little buggers had a strong bite, and he heaved violently to scare them away.</p> <p>As the first moon rose, he saw the insects flying en masse in the shaft of light that was slowly easing its way towards him. He began to buck against the ropes, hoping beyond hope, the Emperor save him, for the insects would surely eat him alive.</p> <p>**</p> <p>Airgoidh and RageChild each woke at the same time, rubbing and coddling their ears.</p> <p>The sound had been terrible. They were seated in a cave of scoured malinite, which was taking on a strange green hue even as the looked around in semi-wakefulness.</p> <p>Thankfully cool, it was not as cold as the lance bubble had been near the last. Mostly natural, the cave had many accouterments of man, mostly Matari symbols for freedom and death were painted on the walls, and a large metal pole lay across the mouth of an inner cave, deep in the darkness.</p> <p>\"Hello sisters,\" a voice said, echoing in the cave from no discernable source. \"Welcome to the Cave of the Sun Warden.\"</p> <p>Airgoidh recognized the voice, and stood with her bare feet sinking slightly in the cave muck. \"Sister? Where are you?\" She did not jump when the hand touched her shoulder, although RageChild spun on her heels, ready for the attack.</p> <p>\"Calm yourself sister RageChild. None here but the Rona.\" Gaelbhan reached out and made the symbol of the Paratwa, a semi-circular movement reminiscent of a crescent moon, followed by the palm outward at the center.</p> <p>\"Your leaving taking from the Sect raised many a hair, sister Wulf,\" RageChild said, shaking off the sand and muck. \"Some in in the Sect that would hunt us down if the Amarr were not the primary targets.\"</p> <p>Gaelbhan clutched Airgoidh, and then turned to RageChild. \"The hunt? The moons in the sky hunt even the sun. It is a good thing then that one cannot handle war on so many fronts. The Cycle be done.\"</p> <p>\"The Cycle be done,\" RageChild replied, affirming the last words of the Faith of Cizin.</p> <p>I am sorry for the delay in rescue, and the use of the shield.\" Gaelbhan motioned down for them to follow her along the cavern wall. She raised the lance, which lit the way in pale blue light. \"I would rather that the locals found their corpses dead by natural causes rather than by lance fire.\"</p> <p>\"What was that keening?\" RageChild asked, following last.</p> <p>\"The old lava vents get filled with wind vapors, which become superheated in the daytime. The vapor causes the whole vent to become an air pump, and so the sound. The Amarr will be found, trapped in the outcropping, having ventured too close and tarried too long. I have already confiscated their ships, and turned off the tracking modules. The probe was already buried beneath the sands.\"</p> <p>\"What of the other pilot?\" Airgoidh asked, grinning.</p> <p>Gaelbhan said nothing, but the fleeting image of his bones bleaching in the sun came to them all. Airgoidh stumbled on the pipe that lay at the mouth of the inner cavern. \"What is that?\"</p> <p>\"The youngsters come here and try to dare each other over the line. It is said beyond that pole there be monsters!\"</p> <p>\"Are there, sister?\"</p> <p>\"Only us.\"</p> <p>The inner cavern was filled with a pool of unknown depth, but a narrow path led around the left hand wall into darkness. Dripping water and splashes of tiny cave creatures were the only noises. The light from the lance began to reflect off the quartz in the walls, and Airgoidh felt as if they were walking on a path among the stars. Gaelbhan maintained a fast stride, which RageChild found refreshing. In the inner compounds of the Sect, one had to walk slowly, in reverence. It took a great deal of time to reach anything there.</p> <p>As they rounded the farthest bend of the water pool, Gaelbhan stopped, looking out across the water. Truly, the water seemed as deepest space, the quartz reflections filling the water with the imitation of stars, mere sparkling embers. \"Look there, sisters, and be ready.\"</p> <p>Gaelbhan pointed to the far wall.</p> <p>A moment passed, then a brilliant light flooded the cave from behind them. Even turned away, the light was as intense as any sun. The cave vanished beneath a layer of bright white as the light struck quartz within the walls, reflecting from pool to wall to pool. In the center of the pool, on a raised dais, a large geometric sculpture stood in a channel of light so intense that all three could only steal glimpses of it. The top most section was definitely pyramidal, but they could not see well enough or long enough to determine the shape of the bottom portion.</p> <p>\"The Gate of the Sun Warden, ancient temple built by the Rona Paratwa.\"</p> <p>\"Built by the . . .?\" RageChild shook her head. Whoever heard of ronin congregating together long enough to build anything other than a stack of Amarri corpses. Being Rona meant a solitary path . . . except for those who found their tway.</p> <p>Gaelbhan turned into the light and disappeared within. Airgoidh followed, then RageChild, still leery of such a claim. The light had appeared from a short tunnel lined by strange globes containing burning gases. The light eased into standard room normal as they passed through this tunnel, and they were now inside a complex burrowed from the malinite rock. Inside a cavern larger than they could imagine, stone buildings and footpaths lead outward in a spiral.</p> <p>\"The panel is this way,\" Gaelbhan said, dropping the lance to her side and striding down the path between the rock houses. The houses gave way to oddly shaped rock gardens, some just sitting in the sand as if dropped from the heavens without regard.</p> <p>The panel that Gaelbhan spoke of was a computer of some kind, but neither Airgoidh nor RageChild could determine its origins. The burnished metal and touch screen seemed rather quaint, but the builders of this place were certainly older than many of their own legends.</p> <p>Gaelbhan ran her hand along the left side of the panel, which then lit up. A cruel screeching sound came from the panel followed immediately by a lit display.</p> <p>\"That's a language,\" Airgoidh said as shifting symbols moved from left to right. \"I don't know how I know, but that is a language.\"</p> <p>\"Yes it is, sister,\" Gaelbhan replied. \"I have only begun to recognize it as such, and most of it I cannot translate. After a bit of effort I have discovered something of what the Paratwa once were.\"</p> <p>\"More rhetoric?\" RageChild's face betrayed her interest in the subject, but weary of being preached at, a sentiment Gaelbhan shared.</p> <p>The display grew reddish and a sun appeared to the right. Lines of white light and a rotating symbol were all that remained as the display stopped, seeming in wait-mode. Gaelbhan began to speak, touching the rotating symbol. \"This display is very old, like I said, built by ancients. It is not original to this place, having been created perhaps even before the collapse of the Eve Gate. I suspect it belonged to the the first Paratwa in the regions of Eve. How it got here in this backwater I do not know.\"</p> <p>The rotating symbol disappeared as another took its place, a gray horn like icon that floated out and to the center of the panel. Odd text appeared next to the icon. \"I only just discovered this, although I do not know why or how. When I first found this place, the panel would not even display. That was nearly four years ago.\"</p> <p>\"Four years?\" Airgoidh turned, looking out across the cavern. \"When you were still Dean of the RMS?\"</p> <p>Gaelbhan nodded. \"I discovered this place in old texts, but kept it hidden from those I trusted. I felt a strong attraction to this cavern, and like my sister-of-blood, I often saw it in dreams. Here,\" she pointed to the single icon. \"This one represents the Rona, a single body, as yet unjoined with a tway.\"</p> <p>Touching the icon, another symbol appeared as the Rona glyph dropped to the bottom of the display. \"This is the Tway Glyph.\" \"Now joined and whereas two bodies, both sharing one mind.\" RageChild seemed extremely interested, and her previous tone had died.</p> <p>Gaelbhan touched the second icon, and a third glyph appeared, but once again emerging from the Rona. \"Sister Airgoidh, you are not of the Sect of the Ra, so these things may seem strange to you, but this icon is important to us all. You have heard of the Paratwa, but only as ghosts and myths. Let me tell you of how things were in those days before the Eve Gate.\u201d</p> <p>Gaelbhan spoke of the Paratwa, more a lecture on history than an impassioned speech.</p> <p>\u201cThe Paratwa before the first jump to Eve were decidedly different in the ways that they were created. They were created and cloned, and they were the result of experiments concerning the McQuade Unity.\"</p> <p>She could see that Airgoidh and RageChild did not recognize that phrase. \"We can discuss much of that later, but first I wanted to show you how this third icon is linked. See the line here? It appears from the Rona glyph, and is connected to it.\"</p> <p>\"A child?\" Airgoidh asked.</p> <p>\"A family member, like a sister or brother.\"</p> <p>RageChild's eyebrows rose. \"This Unity you mentioned . . . we learned from the Sect that Paratwa were discovered to actually be twins in those early days. In truth, Cizin, The Transitional One, created the unity of the minds throughout the universe, all to better rebalance the whole. Are you saying that Paratwa are born in more than two bodies?\"</p> <p>Gaelbhan touched the third symbol, and a fourth icon appeared and slid into position. \"The McQuade Unity was the original experiment by humans on other humans, in truth Cizin's knowledge birthing in the minds of those scientists. In the beginning, Paratwa were discovered to be twins, but as Cizin endowed the scientists with greater knowledge, they discovered that the McQuade Unity contained sympathetic resonance in the embryos. They had previously believed that the embroyos separating into more than two divisible and complete entities was an error, but soon learned it was the natural growth pattern of Paratwa.\"</p> <p>Gaelbhan turned to them, pointing to the fourth symbol as another line broke from it and moved left. A series of four dots appeared, and then lines, then two more dots above and below connected the thing together. As the panel stopped, lines connected the six dots, and the four Rona icons had moved to the far left. \"The Paratwa are more than twins, more than anything we imagined before. The Unity of Mind is shown here. So, sisters, to answer your questions, we do not normally unite in just two bodies, nor three.\"</p> <p>\"We are four?\" RageChild whispered.</p> <p>Gaelbhan nodded. \"We are four. These last two points represent the shared minds of the two pairs of tway. A Unity. And sister-of-blood, you are a Paratwa, a member of our Unity.\u201d</p> <p>Airgoidh seemed out of sorts, but Gaelbhan touched her shoulder. \"We are blood sisters, you and I. We are mothered by the same parents, and just as you did, I had dreamed of you for years before we rescued each other from the Amarr. I do not fully understand this,\" she said, pointing to the panel, \"and I can imagine you do not either. You were not of the Sect, but being of the Sect of the Paratwa Ra is not a requirement to be who you are. RageChild and I are Rona, the Cast-Off. It is more important that we are sisters.\"</p> <p>RageChild too clutched Airgoidh close. She had come looking for Gaelbhan here on Amamake for an explanation of why her sister-of-faith had left the Sect, and perhaps even to see if they were indeed tway. Now she learned that this young Brutor standing beside her, Airgoidh, was also her tway. \"We are sisters, the three. Paratwa, Rona, the enslaved liberated. I do not fear this, and so I ask that you do not fear, sister. Remember the bright light within your mind as you dreamed of Gaelbhan, and how it guided you yesterday when you were chased on the sands by the Amarr - that is our strength, no matter how far apart we may be.\u201d</p> <p>Airgoidh seemed to settle somewhat, but RageChild realized the problem. \u201cYou two say you are sisters-of-blood. But you are Sebiestor, Gaelbhan, and she is Brutor as I am. How can she be from the same Sebiestor mother?\u201d</p> <p>Gaelbhan took on the look of a troubled mind, perhaps remembering how her mother had died. \u201cGood sister, do not be taken in by the Amarrian science that pervades our schools. Our mother was the daughter of a Brutor and a Sebiestor, and for many that is a curse. I do not speak of it to others for that reason. Despite the Amarrians belief in us as genetically simple animals, I am Sebiestor and she is Brutor because of our mother\u2019s mixed genetic heritage. The intentions of Cizin are unknowable as a whole,  ut his genetic manipulation has evident through the universe.\u201d</p> <p>Gaelbhan untangled herself enough to touch the Unity glyph, and a series of three separate lines of text appeared in the center of the display. \"But enough of that. What do you make of those?\"</p> <p>A moment passed, but both Airgoidh and RageChild answered as one even though they did not understand the language. \"Coordinates.\"</p> <p>\"Yes, sisters, coordinates to the most amazing discovery of my lifetime. A Unity Temple amongst the stars, here in Amamake.\" She laughed, and felt free of many nagging doubts. \"We will rest, then let us away to these coordinates. I have something very special to show you.\"</p> <p>**</p> <p>Zayard found four of the Amarri, each gripping the others in a tight ball, their faces ones of pain and madness. Stupid. The malinite howling would have caused that, he knew, but where was the fifth pilot?</p> <p>He wandered a bit in the outcropping, stepping into a circular depression and cool air.</p> <p>The sun had risen, but had not reached down into the depression as yet. Zayard found his fifth pilot there, on the ground, hardly a bit of flesh on his bones -- sand partially covered him. The Matari moved in closer, disgusted as he found bugs crawling around in his skull, the cause of this one's condition.</p> <p>\"Should listen to the public warning system,\" Zayard said to the pilot, shifting away sand to see if any of the Amarr's gear might be worth salvaging. \"We didn't install that thing for our amusement, ya know.\" The antenna and automated equipment sat on top of his bar in the settlement, really the only place with a full-time staff member of the Peoples' Front in this part of the universe.</p> <p>Finding nothing, he stepped back and stumbled over a protrusion in the sand. He kicked at a stake in the ground, then found the other three along with the ropes that attached the skeleton of the Amarr to these stakes. \"So, death by intentional torture.\"</p> <p>No big loss.</p> <p>*cont...</p>"},{"location":"books/book2/","title":"Book 2 - Revelations of the Faithful","text":"<p>Written by Gaelbhan Wulf, compiled by Rachael'Khan and Jeffers Bos\u2019nia</p> <p></p> <p>Coming soon!</p>"},{"location":"chronicles/YC106-09-13%20The%20Hidden%20Fleet/","title":"The Hidden Fleet","text":""},{"location":"chronicles/YC106-09-13%20The%20Hidden%20Fleet/#zayard-and-the-hidden-fleet","title":"Zayard and the Hidden Fleet","text":"<p>Source: Wayback</p> <p>Shar Tegral, Editor-in-Chief, reporting for Eve Guardian YC106-09-13</p> <p>Zayard, retired Freedom Fighter and owner of Luci's Bar on Amamake VI.

You don\u2019t know what those are, I\u2019m sure, but these hangars are the oldest hangars on this station. They were actually going to be removed and offices and laboratories were being put there, but someone paid a lot of isk to keep those hangars. They are also well out of the way of normal traffic, and the main station doors are still sealed to outsiders.</p> <p>Its what\u2019s going on inside that is the story! I had a maintenance repair job to replace the quantum/magnetic flux coil in Cordon C, which is actually quite a pain in the butt since these things are about as heavy as a full fledged battleship stuck in molasses. Anyway, back to the strange things in Cordon C. I was there one night trying to get the bucklings undone on the flux coil when a ship comes dropping in! A ship! In Cordon C.</p> <p>And I mean a ship! This isn\u2019t one of these nice new frigates from Hedion or one of those swanky corporations, not this ship. This was an aggressive behemoth, fully fitted with pure out battle modules. Old! Very damned old! Looked in a bit of a sorry state but that\u2019s not the half-of-it. It settles down on the blasted pad I\u2019m working on, knocking me over the side and down into the catch-all with all the thrust this thing was putting out. If it weren\u2019t for that catch-all, I\u2019d be biomass on the station floor a thousand meters below.</p> <p>The insignia of the ship seemed familiar, but I can\u2019t remember where I saw one like it, but anyway the frigate looked aggressive. Pure Matari Freedom Fighter style that one. Damn, I was standing in the catch-all with my eyes wide like some damn baby. Beautiful!</p> <p>Here\u2019s the other part of that story though. A blasted monk comes out of that frigate, yeah that\u2019s right! A monk. All dressed in robes and pretty as you please just scooted away into the station. A monk in a battle-rig like that? I\u2019ve seen \u2018em around too, here in Onga at the market, selling and buying stuff. I don\u2019t know their Order, but they\u2019re regulars I think. Oh, since you probably don\u2019t know, this is the Imperial Armaments Station, moon 5.</p> <p>Yeah, anyway, I was trying to get the latch open of the catch-all when more monks came out of the metalwork. A LOT of monks. They had loaders and dock machinery. I was gonna yell at \u2018em that they couldn\u2019t use that equipment. It takes years to run that stuff right. But they were doing it. Pretty as you please. And efficient too, the bastards. Monks running loaders and lifts? What\u2019s Eve coming to?</p> <p>Anyway, they refit that frigate with new stuff, and boy, I\u2019d love to fly in one those babies. Pure Matari there. Anyone getting in the way of that baby is gonna know pain.</p> <p>Anyway, please remember that I got five kids to feed, so if you run this story, maybe I could get some isk? Just a little?

I could\u2019a slapped myself silly for forgetting something like that. Listen, I\u2019m a little concerned and a little excited here so bear with me a bit. This is just so amazing.</p> <p>I checked it with my PAD as it relates to historical events and peoples \u2013 especially as it relates to the rebellion! The insignia is from that era! How amazing is that?! There was a cross-link from the historical documents to that old children\u2019s fable, ya know the one, the one about the pre-republic fleet. The Matar\u2019a\u2019Son!</p> <p>I looked up a bunch of stuff in the archives, and boy, let me tell you it was morning before I realized it.</p> <p>The ship I saw dock was a frigate from the Matar\u2019a\u2019Son, I\u2019m sure of it. It looks just like the holovids show those ships were like. This one looked like it was pulled straight from the mothball though, so it HAS to be one of them! My heart soared and I\u2019m just so excited. I hope these ships are going to be used against the stinking Amarr though, and not stuck in some damn Republic museum. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m all for the Republic, but ships like that in a museum? Matar damn them all if they do that.</p> <p>But then why would those monks be refitting the ships with new weapons and modules? They\u2019re gonna take those ships into Amarr! It has to be!</p> <p>The ship\u2019s insignia wasn\u2019t faked. No Matari would do that, especially since THIS particular insignia was from the wing called Tetri\u2019cas\u2019morte. You probably don\u2019t know what that is, but the very name scares me. They were the ships that were modified to counter the Tetrimon during the uprising. Those blasted Tetrimon were vicious, and quick. We died by the thousands under their fire, but the Tetri\u2019cas\u2019morte came on the scene. Even the Amarr cultists ran from them!</p> <p>Well, that\u2019s how they got their nickname, the Flying Devils. Does my Matari heart proud.</p> <p>You might not know this either, but you\u2019re a reporter so maybe linguistics is your thing. I don\u2019t know. The word Matar\u2019a\u2019Son is old Matari, and I do MEAN old! The suffix a\u2019Son or it\u2019s derivatives like \u2018Son means Soul of . .. so Matar\u2019a\u2019Son means Soul of Matar. I found some references too of places and stuff, though it looks like there ain\u2019t too many places that use that suffix. The only place I could find was on Amamake VI. Theres these two mountains called the Twin Mounts of Amake\u2019Son, which is the Soul of the U\u2019 Maak\u2019a\u2019kee. That isn\u2019t the half of it either, as the translation to modern Matari means Soul of the Blood Warriors of Maak.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know how any of that may help the story, but I think something big is happening soon, and I do mean SOON! Cordon C is now blocked off from even us maintenance workers, so that takes big spenders. Who are these big spenders? The monks? Some Matari Freedom Fighters or whatever?</p> <p>I can only imagine what horrors the Amarr would face when a fleet of thousands of these ships jumped in their space. I remember the Day of Darkness story, and how we were enslaved as the Amarr took our people after that day. I think their Day of Darkness is going to be worse. I am glad, and I am scared. Glad the Amarr will be dead, and scared because if those ships, those symbols of our power and strength of desire to be free should falter, what will happen to us?</p> <p>Jeffers Bos\u2019Nia Dock Worker, Matari</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"chronicles/YC106-09-13%20The%20Hidden%20Fleet/#deployment-of-matarason-ships","title":"Deployment of Matar'a'Son Ships","text":"<p>Source: Beyond Reach Archive YC106-09-21</p> <p>Distribution: Matari Free*Net Security: Top Secret To: All Council Members</p> <p>Dear Friends,</p> <p>I am please to announce that Beyond Reach is sponsoring a program to provide free warships to Matari freedom fighters.</p> <p>I am sure all of you know the story of the Hidden Fleet - the legendary fleet of Matar'a'Son that helped to wrest out freedom from Amarr.

The Great Ministry Complex stretched for five thousand meters in each direction, floating atop the Salten Sea not but three hundred leagues from the Kador Principality. Built from malinite, its smooth surface spoke of ten thousand years of slave labor, for malinite was extremely hard. Might as well have sought to make the Amarr sun go supervona as work with malinite, let alone get it polished to its finest sheen.</p> <p>The Call came after those four hours, and he had been ushered into the Chamber of Supreme Ministers with no further announcement. Indeed, all within knew who he was and what had occurred in Tararan just hours prior.</p> <p>The audience with the Supreme Ministers was simply to end his life, or possibly to grant extension until the matter could be rectified. He had doubts he would be given another chance.</p> <p>Daison Kador, one of the Minsters began, his voice solid and without emotion. Your short time with the Ministry is a timetable of disasters.</p> <p>Yes, Supreme Minister, he replied. Standing at attention in the center of the circular chamber, his own voice seemed to have none of the strength of his accuser despite having no fear of them. The acoustics of the chamber were designed to give the Supreme Ministers a strong voice while making the attendee sound quite weak.</p> <p>Of notable concern is the escape of the terrorist, Gaelbhan Wulf, from the prison ship.</p> <p>Yes, Supreme Minister, he replied. The chamber was circular, about forty meters in diameter, with the Supreme Ministers seated in a semi-circle along the inner wall. Sections of the wall were perforated panels of malinite, but the Viewers within were unknown. It was said that often the Emperor himself was behind those panels, but Daison found such rumors to be the childish stories of young pilots.</p> <p>Of most recent concern is the loss of any piece or remnant of the cruiser from the Matar'a'Son Fleet.</p> <p>Yes, Supreme Minister, he replied. He might as well have answered in the negative, or stood on his head and sang a Matari song for all the interest the Ministers were showing. Daison took his eyes from the panels behind his superiors, and eyed each of the Amarrians seated in front of him. They were indeed little interested in him or his responses. Only the voice of the one Supreme Minister seemed to break with that statement's truth, but seemingly a formality.</p> <p>It is unacceptable that the Matari were able to bypass an assembled fleet of at least twelve Amarrian ships, as well as that nothing of the cruiser or its data is now in our custody.</p> <p>Yes, Supreme Minister, he replied, then, And it is regrettable that my efforts are being so ignored.</p> <p>That did it. The Supreme Ministers, as a whole, looked at him. Their eyes were revealing, and Daison continued. You sent me to retrieve this ship, at great expense to the Amarr Empire, and to collect what information I could. This Council sanctioned the faithful services of PIE, as well as others. Efforts were made, and the loss regrettable, but I find that the data was not the only reason I was sent.</p> <p>Yes, Minister Kador, they replied as one voice.</p> <p>The panel behind the center Minister slid open. From the darkness within the alcove came a robed figure, the color of the robe and the sheer height of the Amarrian speaking to Daison as both an historical image and a childhood fear. Tetrimon.</p> <p>You are more observant than credited hitherto, Minister Kador. The monk in the red robes spoke as if from his whole body. The robes shimmered around and behind him as he walked through the Supreme Ministers in their chairs, to stand one meter from him. Daison looked down at his own tunic, and the red swatch that led from the shoulder to the wrist. Minister of Internal Order, Section 8. He spoke, The cruiser from the Hidden Fleet is a loss, but its data chips weren't of prime importance to this Council. As a symbol of the MinMatar rebellion, it might have stirred many of the terrorists to brutal attacks.</p> <p>The Matari are broken tribes. The Hidden Fleet has done nothing to stir them en masse, so what worth is one cruiser?</p> <p>Daison let caution find its own mark in the world, and he started to walk, taking a circular path around the Tetrimon monk. Any repercussions from his disobedience to the protocols of this chamber were simply being ignored. Even the two Ministry Guard in attendance at the door to the chamber did nothing.</p> <p>Yet, the Hidden Fleet disturbs you. It is perhaps an affront to the Tetrimon, an attack of the soul. Your kind affected great loss to the Matari during the rebellion, but they created their own fleet of specialized ships and countered your efforts.</p> <p>You give great credit to the skill of the Matari.</p> <p>Daison stopped, thinking. Are you suggesting that the MinMatar and their rebellion were assisted by Amarrians?</p> <p>I am stating it.</p> <p>But not the whole truth. Daison let his mind roam the possibilities, for that was how Amarrian politics worked. One's mind simply had to let go, and most of the odd and strange thoughts that occurred to the political thinker were in truth enacted or planned.</p> <p>The truth is subjective, Minister Kador. Honesty is not.</p> <p>Daison looked up into the cowl of the Tetrimon monk. He was shorter than the man, Emperor's Hell, every Amarrian was shorter than these cultists. He felt the strength of will of the monk, and he relished it. The Tetrimon secretly assisted the MinMatar while also outwardly attempting to quell the rebellion.</p> <p>Go on.</p> <p>And the Emperor approved of it.</p> <p>Go on.</p> <p>You wanted this cruiser because it holds a key to that history -- a key that would give away that connection, but also something that you needed to verify. That these ships were indeed from the Hidden Fleet.</p> <p>Go on.</p> <p>But why would the Tetrimon help the Matari?</p> <p>Precisely the question to be asked, but no longer your concern, Minister Kador.</p> <p>The monk's arm lifted and Daison heard the shot. It took a moment for him to smell the ozone of the pistol, then the warm wetness running down his chest. He simply fell backward.</p> <p>Death.</p> <p>\"Note for the log,\" one of the Supreme Minsters said, \"that Minister Daison Kador was executed for extreme failures of judgement, tantamount to this Council as treason.</p>"},{"location":"chronicles/YC106-10-13%20The%20%20Origin%20of%20Ronin%20Kanly/","title":"The Origin of Ronin Kanly - War with the Order of Beyond Reach","text":"<p>Source: eve-search</p> Actor Date <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

These terminals displayed people and places throughout the worlds of Eve, events as they unfolded, and the monks made notes. The monastery housed dozens of such rooms, high on the granite cliffs amidst the tropical forest prevalent in many rural areas of Onga.</p> <p>On some monitors, Curse Alliance did battle with enemies new and old, while in the Caldari systems, GalNet cams viewed nothing but the marketplaces. All of these various activities were history in the making, but the monks' job was to connect the dots. Perhaps a Caldari soldier would be seen one day at a marketplace buying candy for his three year old son, only to be connected to the sale of arms to Matari dissidents -- while also providing intelligence of those mercenary movements to the Amarr \u00fb connected to these events simply because a small bag of candy popped up on the table where these events happened; all in view of one of the innumerable GalNet cams.</p> <p>The acharya job, as head of the religious order of Beyond Reach, was to oversee this unconventional portion of the order\u00c6s operations. Unfiltered access to raw data often fueled him with new insights of the big picture.</p> <p>\". . . the seven Amarri frigates were located at the dark side of Amarr VIII Moon 9 . . . \" the monk said into his PAD. The acharya stopped, turning back to look at the monk, then the monitor. A video stream coded Amarr Navy showed seven frigates sitting in a baseline formation in orbit of that moon. They looked abandoned.</p> <p>\"Replay,\" The acharya said to the monk, who obediently reset the incoming video stream. The Navy ship ended the warp, the video beginning with a jitter. The moon filled the whole monitor, but the camera drones adjusted the view to the seven objects in lower orbit. Zooming, the seven frigates appeared.</p> <p>\"Replay,\" The acharya said to the monk, who again obediently reset the video. \"That's not typical Navy drone action.\"</p> <p>\"You mean the video isn't from the Amarr fleet?\" The monk asked, replaying it several times. \"Ah yes, the jitter is from a destabilized drone system, not like the Navy equipment at all.\"</p> <p>\"Let me hear the feed.\"</p> <p>The monk flipped the switch to external speaker and reset the video again. \"We've discovered seven frigates in orbit of the ninth moon of Amarr VIII. Although we were able to activate the ship's onboard AI system remotely, the ships were otherwise powered down and all active systems filtered to prevent detection. The ships' black box revealed an Imperial Academy graduate named Jafi Aphuka had piloted them to this location. They look to have been abandoned.\"</p> <p>\"The video feed isn't live. It was recorded.\"</p> <p>\"Acharya? How can you know that?\"</p> <p>He pointed to the farthest ship, its running lights active, only possible when a pilot was interfaced with the ship. \"Someone was on that ship when this video was taking place. Maybe even our young Amarri pilot.\"</p> <p>The feed continued after a pause, the Navy ship sending down a boarding party. The video now appeared to be the personal cam of the Navy Captain sent to investigate the frigates. The Archarya felt more doubt as the video played. He didn't think the people on the video were even Amarr, but still cleverly played.</p> <p>\"Captain,\" one voice said, \"Nothing in the cargo hold, and the systems are unaffected. Nothing to report from damage control.\"</p> <p>\"Very good, Sergeant. Continue the sweep of the other six ships. Keep the channel open.\"</p> <p>Another voice, a female. \"Captain, the ships\u00c6 logs show that they were intended to travel from this location to various stations in Amarr, Sehmy and others . . . on auto-pilot.\"</p> <p>\"Auto-pilot? Then what? Just sit and wait? Get me answers.\"</p> <p>The archarya and the monk watched as the video played through to the last ship. The first six ships' cargo holds were empty, the ships seemingly abandoned, and the systems checked satisfactory.</p> <p>\"Sir! We found a body!\"</p> <p>The Captain moved down the corridor to the cargo hold of the seventh ship, RIN Soul of Amarr, bypassing personnel whose heads always managed to be turned away or not in the frame. The body of an Amarr lay in the hold, curled into a ball, looking very ashen. \"Who is it?\"</p> <p>\"ID tags say it's Jafi Aphuka. And sir? The salvage teams are reporting they found some objects onboard the other ships now. We found one too, over there.\"</p> <p>\"What kind of objects?\" The Captain asked, his cam moving toward the direction pointed. The screen panned the floor, then on an object attached to the wall of the hold. As the lights all gathered in that corner, they illuminated a large scepter like object, with a sun flaring at the top of a long rod; a Khumaak.</p> <p>\"Well, now I've seen everything.\" The Captain waited a moment more for the cam to conveniently catch a few more moments of the Khumaak, and then he reached down to the body, turning it slightly onto its side. Of course, the cam never showed the Captain's face, mounted on the shoulder, but it did catch the Amarr pilot's face full frame. The Captain backed up, yelling.</p> <p>\"Who checked for virals? Well?\"</p> <p>\"Standard checks Sir. Nothing.\"</p> <p>The archarya replayed that last sequence, stopping the video just as the face of Jafi Aphuka appeared on screen. Ashen face and blue lips indicated a standard viral agent, but why were the ears also blue? He had never seen a viral with that additional epidermal symptom.</p> <p>The acharya stepped back to the wall, thinking. Odd set of circumstances, and some chilling results yet to be seen, he thought. Why would an Amarr pilot have seven ships sitting in orbit on the far side of a moon? These ships were destined for populated stations, and a viral agent was involved, so somehow the young Amarr had become mixed up in terrorist activities \u00fb but whose activities? Matari? What was the significance of the Khumaak?</p> <p>Not just one Khumaak, but seven . . ..</p> <p>Whereas one might suppose Matari terrorists based on that, the acharya never jumped to a conclusion. He snapped his fingers -- a couple of weeks ago, a Matari terrorist had fired on and left ships to burn outside the Emperor's Station in Sehmy. Then there was that other incident . . . where was that? \"Pull up file 37-A21.\"</p> <p>\"Yes, acharya.\" The monitor replayed an incident in Aranir in which a Matari ship self-destructed just outside a station there. The Matari, named Ajahn, appeared in the screen speaking his last few words before the ship became debris.</p> <p>\"I make this sacrifice for my brothers and sisters in bondage to you foul Amarr! The virus you inflict on the Matari will hold us no more!\"</p> <p>The screen went black, and Archarya replayed it once more. The Matari's face was ashen, his lips and ears were blue. \"He has the same symptoms,\" the monk said, and the acharya nodded. \"What does he mean, the virus won't hold the Matari no more?\"</p> <p>\"Of course!\" The acharya strode down the corridor to his study, leaving the monks to ponder his bright, upbeat attitude.</p> <p>On the monitor that played the faked Navy video, the crew had returned to their ships, calling for medical quarantine. Despite the hubbub of people running and medical condition Alpha Red blaring, a voice managed to be heard over the vessel's intercom.</p> <p>\"Captain, a ship is approaching. It bears the signature of PIE. They\u00c6re saying they\u00c6ve received a delayed communication escrowed to them by the Amarr pilot.\"</p>"},{"location":"chronicles/YC106-08-25%20The%20Virus%20Incident/02%20Investigation/","title":"The Investigation","text":""},{"location":"chronicles/YC106-08-25%20The%20Virus%20Incident/02%20Investigation/#pie-investigation","title":"PIE Investigation","text":"<p>Source: eve-search</p> <p>Gaius Kador [Grand Inquisitor, PIE] YC106-08-25 19:26</p> <p>Preliminary Report</p> <p>To: PIE officers Status: Internal</p> <p>During todays briefing session, I was made aware of an unusual escrow deal being offered to PIE at the Emperor Family station in Amarr.</p> <p>Taking it upon myself to investigate, I summoned a recon wing before claiming the escrow in question.</p> <p>I will withold the destination point until further investigations have been completed, but our findings were interesting.</p> <p>The wing warped in on seven abandoned Impairor class vessels, and long range scanners showed no potential hostile craft within 10000 clicks.</p> <p>Ordering my wingmen Nemesis I and Khyan to hold position at the site, I returned to HQ and boarded a Crucifier class intelligence gatherer.</p> <p>Upon my return, the abandoned vessels were scanned.</p> <p>Their mounted loadouts proved uninteresting, but their cargo was another matter entirely:</p> <ul> <li>RIN Soul of Amarr - 1 Viral Agent, 1 Khumaak, 1 Corpse (Jafi Aphuka)</li> <li>RIN Servant of God - 1 Viral agent, 1 Khumaak</li> <li>RIN Warden - 1 viral agent, 1 khumaak</li> <li>RIN Adamant - 1 viral agent, 1 khumaak</li> <li>RIN Faithful - 1 viral agent, 1 khumaak</li> <li>RIN Resolute - 1 viral agent, 1 khumaak</li> <li>RIN Righteous - 1 viral agent, 1 khumaak</li> </ul> <p>After a brief discussion with the PIE personnel at the site, it was decided to take the vessels in question into PIE custody and move them to a quarantine site some 1000 clicks off the original location of the Impairors.</p> <p>Bookmarks to this location can be obtained by contacting myself.</p> <p>All the ship systems have been disabled, the cargo left intact save for the corpse of Jafi Aphuka, which has been properly sealed off and moved to PIE HQ for medical testing.</p> <p>However.</p> <p>Medical results can take a while to analyse, as such I suggest we test the viral agent out in containment at the quarantine site, exposing slave livestock to the viral agents.</p> <p>This is clearly some vile matari plot against the Empire, and we should uncover the truth to this matter as efficiently as possible.</p> <p>END OF REPORT</p> <p></p> Utham [Commander, Republic Security Force Guard] YC106-08-25 20:50 <p>Scum!

I have recently taken upon operations without the jurisdiction of your command, i can only hope my course of action was the right one. After noting with interest intercepted communications about these deathships, i noted contact with Acharya and managed to retrieve the last known co-ordiantes of these 'Deathships'. Along with brother Darax and sister AngelGrinder we proceeded to Amarr space to locate these ships and see if we could deduce what was happening.</p> <p>Upon arrival at co-ordinates we found no evidence of the ships, however, Darax managed to locate the ships sitting 1000k out and we proceeded to this location. Upon arrival we found 7 Amarrian frigates and a cargo container.</p> <p>The cargo container contained.. sorry commanders, the sight shook me somewhat, as the man was in a bad condition. we found a Matari, a slave judging by the slaver marks on him. he was unconcious and in a serious condition. I transfered the slave to a quaratine section of my hull, as rumours had persisted of a viral agent on these ships.</p> <p>Upon scanning the 7 ships we located khumaaks and a viral agent upon each. After discussion with my fellow pilots, we decided to take a sample of this viral agent safely quarantined within my cargo hold and the khumaaks for analysis. We destroyed all the ships after we had retrieved the items. We judged that from what information we had gleaned this viral agent was very dangerous and could ill afford it getting into the wrong hands.</p> <p>I am now on my way out of the system and am requesting orders as to the safest place to take these objects, i suggest a remote outpost. Speed is of the neccesity as the slave we rescued may not last much longer.</p> <p>Also commanders... there was a number of PIE in system, they knew of our presence, and i have no doubt they knew of our destination (though i may be mistaken here) but we were not challenged or engaged and were able to make our escape without seeing a single enemy. i find this... perplexing.</p> <p>Awaiting Orders ASAP Khaldorn Murino</p> <p>+++ END REPORT ++++</p> <p>Khaldorn felt the sweat dripping down his body even inside the pod.

It might become necessary for us to enlist the assistance of the infamous Jericho Fraction geneticist Athule Snanm to obtain the intel we are looking for. He has no equal within his field of expertise.</p> <p>However, as predicted, the following cycle of events have taken place.</p> <p>Intelligence leaks due to the low security rating of my former briefing made terrorist elements aware of the ongoing debacle. The subsequent 'easy to find' quarantine post was located by the very same terrorist elements.</p> <p>They would not only happen upon the ships at the site however, I had previosly taken it upon myself and a tech crew to deposit a slave at the site, and subsequently exposed him to the agent. I take full personal responsibility for this fact, but neither will I share with you the credit for my action.</p> <p>As noted by Tharrn, the CEO of Primus Pilum, a loyalist corporation, I have reasons to believe the ships were primed at essential installations in the heart of our Empire. Two in Amarr Prime, one each in the regional capitals of our Heirs.</p> <p>By 'allowing' the terrorist elements access to the quarantine site, they did our work for us, as I just recieved confirmation that all seven Impairors have been destroyed.</p> <p>Make no mistake. I wanted this site found, I wanted the slave retrieved and I wanted them home with their cargo intact.</p> <p>I wanted them to witness their own abominable creation at work.</p> <p>As an amusing sidenote, we recieved no communication of the Khumaaks present in the holds being destroyed along with the ships, as well as the names of known terrorists reported by CONCORD as being responsible for the destruction of said vessels.</p> <p>They simply saved us the hassle of eventually destroying the vessels ourselves.</p> <p>The infected slave has also been removed from the site, as predicted, and is most probably now in some scrapheap matari station, infected by the vile sickness they themselves sought to inflict on us. Let him now infect his own kin instead, if the matari be careless enough to break containment procedures.</p> <p>Let them fight to find a cure, if my suspicions are correct regarding the slave in question, there is little hope for him as I made certain he had in no way been exposed to any chemical substances in advance.</p> <p>Knowing the freedom fighters and their ilk, I would suspect either a trigger for the viral agent to activate, OR the PRESENCE of such to keep it IMPOTENT. What better trigger to keep the viral agent impotent than vitoc?</p> <p>My only regret now is that I did not deposit a vitoc reliant slave in the containment alongside the clean livestock. He could then witness the same subhuman sufferings his 'saviors' would want to inflict upon thousands of innocent lives. IF my assumptions are correct, of course, but I am rarely mistaken.</p> <p>We must be prepared for eventual repetitions of this action, and certainly the matari scum have in their posession a sample of the viral agent by now, but it does not matter.</p> <p>So do we.</p> <p>END OF REPORT</p>"},{"location":"chronicles/YC106-08-25%20The%20Virus%20Incident/02%20Investigation/#preliminary-medical-report","title":"Preliminary Medical Report","text":"<p>Amarria Darcest [Supervising Medical Officer, Hedion University Medical Lab] YC106-08-26 02:28</p> <p>Preliminary report</p> <p>To: Hedion University Medical Lab From: Amarria Darcrest, Attache Supervising Medical Officer Status: Internal</p> <p>This report will describe, in brief, my preliminary findings of the case of viral outbreak here at the Emperor's Station, Amarr system, Eve-Standard Time 02:04.</p> <p>As already known, thirteen cases of viral outbreak have occured at the Emperor's Station today.

Our sources indicate that a viral agent with symtoms simular to Lysomes III-B has been discovered. I have measured the vial that we have and we are 2 milliliters short of the amount your report says was collected.</p> <p>Pulgor&gt; That virus is fatel! Our antidote only works within the first 15 hours of infection. After that it is unstoppable and death is immanent in the next 24 hours. It also has a high mutation rate and our antidote may not work anymore! Has it gotten into the public!?</p> <p>PC-4772&gt; We don't know, we know that PIE found some earlier and are running exparaments on it right now.</p> <p>Pulgor&gt; See if your source can get a sample of the virus and make SURE it's Lysomes III-B, if it is, let me know. I'll have to put an advisory out and we will have to trace infection and contain it. If this thing gets in the open there is no limit to the damage it can do.</p> <p>PC-4772&gt; Yes sir, should I do anything in the mean time?</p> <p>Pulgor&gt; No, do not alert anyone. I don't want panic to break out before we can determine if it's Lysomes III-B. As well it has a short life with no host so it may have dissapated itself by now. That's how we managed to contain it at the Ministry of War station. Hopefully not many get infected in the meantime.</p> <p>PC-4772&gt; Yes sir, I'll carry out your orders.

I state the facts as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Matari slaves do contract the infection</li> <li>Matari slaves maintain the standard symptoms for twelve hours generally</li> <li>Matari slaves recover thereafter, and seem to return to normal health within the next few hours</li> <li>Not every Matari slave survives the infection</li> </ul> <p>I do not understand the reasoning why, but I suspect this virus is designed to circumvent the controls introduced to their bodies, and then continue to the next round of infection through the slaves' themselves exponentially. I have yet to check on the slaves' circumstances and control-methods.</p> <p>I am compiling this information now.</p> <p>So many dying.

Under carful examination it appears to be a grown copy of the Lysomes-III-B culture. However it's been altered.</p> <p>Pulgor&gt; Altered?</p> <p>PC-4772&gt; Yes, the virus appears to have been altered to only affect Amarr tissue. Minmatar tissue seems to be immune. Caldari and Gallente tissue samples are enroute to examine reaction to those tissue samples. We have renamed this virus Lysomes III-B2. It is not a true mutation in the tradition of Lysomes viruses, it seems to have been forcibly altered.</p> <p>Pulgor&gt; I see. So it looks like the Blood Raider's altered the sample they took?</p> <p>PC-4772&gt; That's what confuses me. This work is far too good to have been done by the Blood Raiders. They can generally only get out-of-work hacks to do anything for them. It looks like the Blood Raiders sold the virus and whoever they sold it too had it altered is our working theroy.</p> <p>Pulgor&gt; Makes sense.</p> <p>PC-4772&gt; Now that we have confirmation. Should we send out an advisory?</p> <p>Pulgor&gt; I don't think so.</p> <p>PC-4772&gt; This infection is getting serious. An entire station is at risk of infection. I think we really need to get word of this out.</p> <p>Pulgor&gt; It's not our virus anymore. They altered it and it's their problem now. I'm not taking responsability for their misuse of a virus they created.</p> <p>PC-4772&gt; I understand that, but many Amarrians have been infected and it's only going to get worse. I really think we should do something.</p> <p>Pulgor&gt; Our antidote may not work anymore. As for the Amarrians, god will teach them the lesson of their callousness in the matter, not me. God's lessons are harsh but swift.

While I would not normally work with a Minmatar I think I can make this special exception. It is most likely that the new varient of the Lysome's Virus: Lysomes III-B2, Has been engineered in a labouritory to meet certain criteria. What this criteria is, we do not know.</p> <p>I do have a wealth of information on the origional Lysomes III-B virus and am willing to give any research we have gained on it to anyone who wants it. As well, we do have the old antidote which worked on haulting the origional Virus so long as it was administered before 15 hours of the origional infection. If anyone wants any of Lysomes III-B antidote, I will supply it to them.</p>"},{"location":"chronicles/YC106-08-25%20The%20Virus%20Incident/03%20Races%20Given%20Notice/","title":"All Races Given Notice - Free MinMatar Slaves Or Perish","text":"<p>Source: eve-search</p> <p>Jesra [Sect of the Warden] YC106-08-27 00:01:00</p> <p>Release given to EveGuardian moments ago.</p> <p>We, the Sect of the Warden, Degraded MinMatar and banned from our families and our lives, proclaim that we are the group responsible for the release of the retrovirus aboard seven ships in the Amarr system.</p> <p>In synchronization with cohorts from Amarr, MinMatar, Caldari and Gallente, we also proclaim that this effort continues even now. Know this people of Eve \u00fb though the Amarr are the primary targets of this virus, all races will be affected until the Amarr release from enslavement every last MinMatar. It is possible that all races, all men, women and children will become host to our efforts.</p> <p>Do not construe this as the systematic genocide of every soul in the worlds of Eve. This virus is designed to provide complete immunity for MinMatar whose bodies were once or are still infected by Vitoc compounds. To all other races or to MinMatar who have never been subjected to Vitoc, death is assured. Do not inject yourselves with Vitoc to sa***uard yourself; the retrovirus affects only MinMatar in this way whose bodies have developed Long-Range RNA antibodies to fight Vitoc poisoning; a process possible only after several years of poisoning.</p> <p>Our initial groundwork for infection in Amarr was sidestepped when the young Amarri pilot, Jafi Aphuka, cleverly sent secret escrow to various Amarrian officials and corporations the misgivings of his work. Although we have abandoned that initial phase of our plan, just as we abandoned the pilot to his fate, the Sect of the Warden now is ready for the next step of our plan.</p> <p>Whereas none of the other races are immune, there is a medical solution, a treatment for the virus the Amarr are calling the \u00f4Scourge.\u00f6 Many will die. Who will be the first? Is that knowledge something you can live with?</p> <p>The Sect has placed four delivery cases with enough supplies to treat one hundred people in escrow on the Pator Tech School station, Amamake system. These escrows are available to all, and contain your races\u00c6 specific treatment. A representative from each of the four involved races is asked to claim these cases for their race; these items are available only for six days as of the date of this release. Of course, you will likely attempt to reverse engineer the treatment and produce more \u00fb futile effort. Do not waste time.</p> <p>On the seventh day, if the Amarr have not begun efforts to transition the Matari slaves to freedom in an acceptable and orderly manner, our fleet of ships will dock at every major station in every empire-based system.

Several station managers have reported medical team quaratine and Amarr citizenry infection. Though these numbers currently are quite small, it is my learned opinion that we must not take the threats of these terrorists lightly.</p> <p>Secondly, I am assigned to investigate the disappearance of Doctor Amarria Darcest last night from her Hedion Medical Lab. Her transmission was at first suspect, but later proven to be coded with her UID signature. That said:</p> <pre><code>Dr. Amarria Darcest disappeared into the Devoid Constellation, and her whereabouts are being sought.\n\nHer own transmission is confession of heresy\n</code></pre> <p>Is the Emperor and the Chosen of God to believe that the virus is cured by its injection into Amarr citizenry, at the cost of perhaps \u00bd the citizenry?

Can the Amarr, as the Chosen of God, sit idle and let the terrorists go unpunished?</p> <p>We are the Chosen, and God's power shines down on us because we are a superior race. Although humans entered the Eve Gate thousands of years ago, some of them were also the Chosen, superior and knowledgable in their faith. Mere blood chemistry is not the source of our faith.</p> <p>Lastly, all Amarr are asked to provide information concerning the doctor's whereabouts to me in any manner that is most available to them. Her words are heresy, and her disappearance is suspect. I would hesitate to think that she was in collusion with the terrorists . . ..</p> <p>She is Amarr, and charged with heresy for her words.
