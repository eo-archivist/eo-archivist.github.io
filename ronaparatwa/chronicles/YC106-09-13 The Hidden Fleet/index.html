<p>Zayard, retired Freedom Fighter and owner of Luci's Bar on Amamake VI. What involve did he have? What drove this warrior and what caused his brutal murder?</p>
<p>I sat with Kas'Rah Dannalor finding out about this distinguished warrior.</p>
<p>"Zayard was the finest Brutor I ever served with. He saved my life more times than we can count. And we were of the old school. No cloning for us. Just ourselves, untarnished, spilling our blood for our people. Dedication like that is ingrained into your bones, seared in from countless laser burns from Amarran scum."</p>
<p>"He couldn't just retire. He wanted out of the limelight but he still couldn't just go quietly into the night. He worked for the People's Front as a Comm-Relay Operator. He sacrificed for the Matari, even to the end."</p>
<p>"Zayard was one for the pretty girls of course. I think good drink, good cheer, and a pleasing face was the sum of his desires. However he did have a secret penchant for mythology."</p>
<p>"Myths? Well Zayard had this fascination with the old wive's tale about the 'Hidden Fleet'. You don't know anything about that? What are young Matari coming to?"</p>
<p>"'The Hidden Fleet' is an old story, hardly credible but exciting. It is the legendary fleet of Matar'a'Son that helped to wrest out freedom from that Amarran yoke of slavery. It was mothballed in a secret location for use when we became a True Republic."</p>
<p>"The location was hidden and passed out of memory. All those involved have long since joined our ancestors. No one living knew anything about it but I think Zayard discovered something."</p>
<p>"Zayard was fascinated about the legend. He was dedicated to Matari Freedom and this fleet, containing a huge inventory of ships, would ensure that the Matari could maintain their freedom... charging into the throats of any suppressor. The finest testiment of life that a Freedom Fighter can achieve."</p>
<p>"Those Angel scum killed my friend. It was their weapon signatures found on all of the murdered Matari. They shall pay for this horror."</p>

<p>Good people of Eve Guardian!</p>
<p>I am a simple dock worker in Onga with five kids to feed, so I hope the information I am about to relay is suitable for publication and a little . . . recognition of my need to feed my little babies.</p>
<p>A while ago, our Cordon C style hangars were renovated. You don’t know what those are, I’m sure, but these hangars are the oldest hangars on this station. They were actually going to be removed and offices and laboratories were being put there, but someone paid a lot of isk to keep those hangars. They are also well out of the way of normal traffic, and the main station doors are still sealed to outsiders.</p>
<p>Its what’s going on inside that is the story! I had a maintenance repair job to replace the quantum/magnetic flux coil in Cordon C, which is actually quite a pain in the butt since these things are about as heavy as a full fledged battleship stuck in molasses. Anyway, back to the strange things in Cordon C. I was there one night trying to get the bucklings undone on the flux coil when a ship comes dropping in! A ship! In Cordon C.</p>
<p>And I mean a ship! This isn’t one of these nice new frigates from Hedion or one of those swanky corporations, not this ship. This was an aggressive behemoth, fully fitted with pure out battle modules. Old! Very damned old! Looked in a bit of a sorry state but that’s not the half-of-it. It settles down on the blasted pad I’m working on, knocking me over the side and down into the catch-all with all the thrust this thing was putting out. If it weren’t for that catch-all, I’d be biomass on the station floor a thousand meters below.</p>
<p>The insignia of the ship seemed familiar, but I can’t remember where I saw one like it, but anyway the frigate looked aggressive. Pure Matari Freedom Fighter style that one. Damn, I was standing in the catch-all with my eyes wide like some damn baby. Beautiful!</p>
<p>Here’s the other part of that story though. A blasted monk comes out of that frigate, yeah that’s right! A monk. All dressed in robes and pretty as you please just scooted away into the station. A monk in a battle-rig like that? I’ve seen ‘em around too, here in Onga at the market, selling and buying stuff. I don’t know their Order, but they’re regulars I think. Oh, since you probably don’t know, this is the Imperial Armaments Station, moon 5.</p>
<p>Yeah, anyway, I was trying to get the latch open of the catch-all when more monks came out of the metalwork. A LOT of monks. They had loaders and dock machinery. I was gonna yell at ‘em that they couldn’t use that equipment. It takes years to run that stuff right. But they were doing it. Pretty as you please. And efficient too, the bastards. Monks running loaders and lifts? What’s Eve coming to?</p>
<p>Anyway, they refit that frigate with new stuff, and boy, I’d love to fly in one those babies. Pure Matari there. Anyone getting in the way of that baby is gonna know pain.</p>
<p>Anyway, please remember that I got five kids to feed, so if you run this story, maybe I could get some isk? Just a little? A 100 would do it.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I remember where I saw that old insignia from, on that frigate that docked in Onga! I could’a slapped myself silly for forgetting something like that. Listen, I’m a little concerned and a little excited here so bear with me a bit. This is just so amazing.</p>
<p>I checked it with my PAD as it relates to historical events and peoples – especially as it relates to the rebellion! The insignia is from that era! How amazing is that?! There was a cross-link from the historical documents to that old children’s fable, ya know the one, the one about the pre-republic fleet. The Matar’a’Son!</p>
<p>I looked up a bunch of stuff in the archives, and boy, let me tell you it was morning before I realized it.</p>
<p>The ship I saw dock was a frigate from the Matar’a’Son, I’m sure of it. It looks just like the holovids show those ships were like. This one looked like it was pulled straight from the mothball though, so it HAS to be one of them! My heart soared and I’m just so excited. I hope these ships are going to be used against the stinking Amarr though, and not stuck in some damn Republic museum. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for the Republic, but ships like that in a museum? Matar damn them all if they do that.</p>
<p>But then why would those monks be refitting the ships with new weapons and modules? They’re gonna take those ships into Amarr! It has to be!</p>
<p>The ship’s insignia wasn’t faked. No Matari would do that, especially since THIS particular insignia was from the wing called Tetri’cas’morte. You probably don’t know what that is, but the very name scares me. They were the ships that were modified to counter the Tetrimon during the uprising. Those blasted Tetrimon were vicious, and quick. We died by the thousands under their fire, but the Tetri’cas’morte came on the scene. Even the Amarr cultists ran from them!</p>
<p>Well, that’s how they got their nickname, the Flying Devils. Does my Matari heart proud.</p>
<p>You might not know this either, but you’re a reporter so maybe linguistics is your thing. I don’t know. The word Matar’a’Son is old Matari, and I do MEAN old! The suffix a’Son or it’s derivatives like ‘Son means Soul of . .. so Matar’a’Son means Soul of Matar. I found some references too of places and stuff, though it looks like there ain’t too many places that use that suffix. The only place I could find was on Amamake VI. Theres these two mountains called the Twin Mounts of Amake’Son, which is the Soul of the U’ Maak’a’kee. That isn’t the half of it either, as the translation to modern Matari means Soul of the Blood Warriors of Maak.</p>
<p>I don’t know how any of that may help the story, but I think something big is happening soon, and I do mean SOON! Cordon C is now blocked off from even us maintenance workers, so that takes big spenders. Who are these big spenders? The monks? Some Matari Freedom Fighters or whatever?</p>
<p>I can only imagine what horrors the Amarr would face when a fleet of thousands of these ships jumped in their space. I remember the Day of Darkness story, and how we were enslaved as the Amarr took our people after that day. I think their Day of Darkness is going to be worse. I am glad, and I am scared. Glad the Amarr will be dead, and scared because if those ships, those symbols of our power and strength of desire to be free should falter, what will happen to us?</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I am please to announce that Beyond Reach is sponsoring a program to provide free warships to Matari freedom fighters.</p>
<p>I am sure all of you know the story of the Hidden Fleet - the legendary fleet of Matar'a'Son that helped to wrest out freedom from Amarr. This fleet is the very strength of what moved us from Amarrian enslavement to a Republic, and symbol of our freedom.  It was mothballed in a secret location for use when our people are in need. But all those people are dead, and the hidden complex, forgotten. Many thought it is nothing but a myth, a children tale.</p>
<p>Well, friends, I am here to tell you it is not a myth. Our Order has discovered one of these hidden locations.  The mothballed ships don’t have the latest technology, and many are in poor condition - but these are proud ships, and it would be a damn shame for them to rust away.</p>
<p>The Matar’a’Son shall fly again!</p>
<p>We are a small religious order, our resource are stretched, but we will work to refurbish these ships and provide them free of cost to our young warriors in need of a trust worthy and war proven ship to continue our fight for freedom for our enslaved brethren.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Any Matari or friends of Matar who is or will be in an active war status with specified Amarri corps (currently any corp. in the CVA) is eligible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only frigates (Rifter, Vigil, and Breacher) will be made available initially.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pilots that demonstrate exceptional valor may be awarded cruiser class vessel at a later date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ships shall all wear the insignia of Matar’a’Son, ie., the ship must be named  “Matar'a'Son <Something>".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are warships, and must never be used as mining vessels or cargo freighters! No miners are ever to be fitted. They are intended for use in war!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is requested that any kills or loses by the pilot onboard Matar’a’Son ship shall be reported to Beyond Reach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replacement is available if a ship is lost honorably in combat.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To request a ship from the Matar’a’Son fleet, send an eve-mail to Acharya, stating any preference for ship type, or location (region).  It might not always be possible to meet your stated preference.</p>

<p><strong>Shar Tegral, Editor-in-Chief, reporting for Eve Guardian</strong><br>
YC106-09-21</p>
<p>Having recieved confirmable information from one of Eve Guardian's sources we have learned that a very old style Matari frigate docked at a station in Onga, in a seldom used docking bay that is long overdue for refit docking bay.</p>
<p>The insignia of the fighter was clearly marked, in the pictures we were allowed to view, with the ancient emblem of the fighter wing this ship was assigned to in all known legends. The fact that a frigate from the Tetri'cas'morte has been sighted lends credence to the legends of the Matar'a'Son Fleet.</p>
<p>The further troubling matters is that one historian, specializing in ancient histories, has identified two key bits of lore. Upon the planet Amamake, where the massacre took place, there is a mythical reference to a pair of prominent mountains. The twin mountains of Amamake are religiously known as the Soul of the U'Maak'a'kee, the modern translation is; Soul of the Blood Warriors of Maak.</p>
<p>The other troubling reference, from pre-republic times, is the legends surrounding the fighter wing Tetri'cas'morte. Often translated as Flying Devils the correct translation refers to their constant superiority over the Order of St. Tetrimon.</p>
<p>It only remains to be seen if the Soul of the Matari Fleet is currently in Matari hands. Or is the sudden reemergence of the Tetrimon Order and this terrorist group, The Sect of the Warden, is truly malfortuitous happenstance.</p>

<p>He fumbled for the winking comlink and fought back the waves of sickness brought on by last night's boosters as he tried to listen to Jules' message.</p>

<strong>Daison Kador [Special Services Section 8, Ministry of Internal Order]</strong></p>
<p>It has come to my attention via sources within the Amarr Empire and from alternative media outlets that the Ministry of Internal Order is being blamed for the disablement of this ship. Such accusations are preposterous!</p>
<p>Since this ship is within the Empire's systems or it's colonies, I will endevour to locate this vessel. I call upon all defenders of the Amarrian peoples to aid me in this project. Please be sure to have on hand a pilot who can fly a Matari cruiser class vessel, for it is my intention to retrieve this ship and take it into spacedock to learn the truth of these allegations.</p>
<p>I call upon all defenders of the Amarrian Empire to also be prepared for Matari terrorist activity both remotely in our search for this vessel as well as at home. No doubt the terrorists will also strike inwardly while we undertake this project!</p>
<p>Amarrians of Faith, I look forward to your</p>

<p><strong>Daison Kador [Special Services Section 8, Ministry of Internal Order]</strong><br>
YC106-09-28</p>
<p>Daison had waited in the antechamber for four hours, standing at attention in the full gaze of the emotionless Ministry Guard. The Great Ministry Complex stretched for five thousand meters in each direction, floating atop the Salten Sea not but three hundred leagues from the Kador Principality. Built from malinite, its smooth surface spoke of ten thousand years of slave labor, for malinite was extremely hard. Might as well have sought to make the Amarr sun go supervona as work with malinite, let alone get it polished to its finest sheen.</p>
<p>The Call came after those four hours, and he had been ushered into the Chamber of Supreme Ministers with no further announcement. Indeed, all within knew who he was and what had occurred in Tararan just hours prior.</p>
<p>The audience with the Supreme Ministers was simply to end his life, or possibly to grant extension until the matter could be rectified. He had doubts he would be given another chance.</p>
<p>Daison Kador, one of the Minsters began, his voice solid and without emotion. Your short time with the Ministry is a timetable of disasters.</p>
<p>Yes, Supreme Minister, he replied. Standing at attention in the center of the circular chamber, his own voice seemed to have none of the strength of his accuser despite having no fear of them. The acoustics of the chamber were designed to give the Supreme Ministers a strong voice while making the attendee sound quite weak.</p>
<p>Of notable concern is the escape of the terrorist, Gaelbhan Wulf, from the prison ship.</p>
<p>Yes, Supreme Minister, he replied. The chamber was circular, about forty meters in diameter, with the Supreme Ministers seated in a semi-circle along the inner wall. Sections of the wall were perforated panels of malinite, but the Viewers within were unknown. It was said that often the Emperor himself was behind those panels, but Daison found such rumors to be the childish stories of young pilots.</p>
<p>Of most recent concern is the loss of any piece or remnant of the cruiser from the Matar'a'Son Fleet.</p>
<p>Yes, Supreme Minister, he replied. He might as well have answered in the negative, or stood on his head and sang a Matari song for all the interest the Ministers were showing. Daison took his eyes from the panels behind his superiors, and eyed each of the Amarrians seated in front of him. They were indeed little interested in him or his responses. Only the voice of the one Supreme Minister seemed to break with that statement's truth, but seemingly a formality.</p>
<p>It is unacceptable that the Matari were able to bypass an assembled fleet of at least twelve Amarrian ships, as well as that nothing of the cruiser or its data is now in our custody.</p>
<p>Yes, Supreme Minister, he replied, then, And it is regrettable that my efforts are being so ignored.</p>
<p>That did it. The Supreme Ministers, as a whole, looked at him. Their eyes were revealing, and Daison continued. You sent me to retrieve this ship, at great expense to the Amarr Empire, and to collect what information I could. This Council sanctioned the faithful services of PIE, as well as others. Efforts were made, and the loss regrettable, but I find that the data was not the only reason I was sent.</p>
<p>Yes, Minister Kador, they replied as one voice.</p>
<p>The panel behind the center Minister slid open. From the darkness within the alcove came a robed figure, the color of the robe and the sheer height of the Amarrian speaking to Daison as both an historical image and a childhood fear. Tetrimon.</p>
<p>You are more observant than credited hitherto, Minister Kador. The monk in the red robes spoke as if from his whole body. The robes shimmered around and behind him as he walked through the Supreme Ministers in their chairs, to stand one meter from him. Daison looked down at his own tunic, and the red swatch that led from the shoulder to the wrist. Minister of Internal Order, Section 8. He spoke, The cruiser from the Hidden Fleet is a loss, but its data chips weren't of prime importance to this Council. As a symbol of the MinMatar rebellion, it might have stirred many of the terrorists to brutal attacks.</p>
<p>The Matari are broken tribes. The Hidden Fleet has done nothing to stir them en masse, so what worth is one cruiser?</p>
<p>Daison let caution find its own mark in the world, and he started to walk, taking a circular path around the Tetrimon monk. Any repercussions from his disobedience to the protocols of this chamber were simply being ignored. Even the two Ministry Guard in attendance at the door to the chamber did nothing.</p>
<p>Yet, the Hidden Fleet disturbs you. It is perhaps an affront to the Tetrimon, an attack of the soul. Your kind affected great loss to the Matari during the rebellion, but they created their own fleet of specialized ships and countered your efforts.</p>
<p>You give great credit to the skill of the Matari.</p>
<p>Daison stopped, thinking. Are you suggesting that the MinMatar and their rebellion were assisted by Amarrians?</p>
<p>I am stating it.</p>
<p>But not the whole truth. Daison let his mind roam the possibilities, for that was how Amarrian politics worked. One's mind simply had to let go, and most of the odd and strange thoughts that occurred to the political thinker were in truth enacted or planned.</p>
<p>The truth is subjective, Minister Kador. Honesty is not.</p>
<p>Daison looked up into the cowl of the Tetrimon monk. He was shorter than the man, Emperor's Hell, every Amarrian was shorter than these cultists. He felt the strength of will of the monk, and he relished it. The Tetrimon secretly assisted the MinMatar while also outwardly attempting to quell the rebellion.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>And the Emperor approved of it.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>You wanted this cruiser because it holds a key to that history -- a key that would give away that connection, but also something that you needed to verify. That these ships were indeed from the Hidden Fleet.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>But why would the Tetrimon help the Matari?</p>
<p>Precisely the question to be asked, but no longer your concern, Minister Kador.</p>
<p>The monk's arm lifted and Daison heard the shot. It took a moment for him to smell the ozone of the pistol, then the warm wetness running down his chest. He simply fell backward.</p>
<p>Death.</p>
<p>"Note for the log," one of the Supreme Minsters said, "that Minister Daison Kador was executed for extreme failures of judgement, tantamount to this Council as treason.</p>
